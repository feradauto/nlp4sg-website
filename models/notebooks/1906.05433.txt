Abstract

Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine learning ex-
perts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how machine learning can be a powerful tool in
reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids
to disaster management, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be ﬁlled by machine
learning, in collaboration with other ﬁelds. Our recommendations encompass exciting research ques-
tions as well as promising business opportunities. We call on the machine learning community to join
the global effort against climate change.

Introduction

The effects of climate change are increasingly visible.1 Storms, droughts, ﬁres, and ﬂooding have become
stronger and more frequent [3]. Global ecosystems are changing, including the natural resources and agri-
culture on which humanity depends. The 2018 intergovernmental report on climate change estimated that
the world will face catastrophic consequences unless global greenhouse gas emissions are eliminated within
thirty years [4]. Yet year after year, these emissions rise.

Addressing climate change involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing for un-
avoidable consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. Adaptation re-
quires planning for resilience and disaster management, given an understanding of climate and extreme
events. Such a diversity of problems can be seen as an opportunity: there are many ways to have an impact.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a broadly powerful tool for technological
progress. Despite the growth of movements applying ML and AI to problems of societal and global good,2
there remains the need for a concerted effort to identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle climate
change. Many ML practitioners wish to act, but are uncertain how. On the other side, many ﬁelds have begun
actively seeking input from the ML community.

This paper aims to provide an overview of where machine learning can be applied with high impact in the
ﬁght against climate change, through either effective engineering or innovative research. The strategies we
highlight include climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as meta-level tools that enable other strategies.
In order to maximize the relevance of our recommendations, we have consulted experts across many ﬁelds
(see Acknowledgments) in the preparation of this paper.

Who is this paper written for?

We believe that our recommendations will prove valuable to several different audiences (detailed below).
In our writing, we have assumed some familiarity with basic terminology in machine learning, but do not
assume any prior familiarity with application domains (such as agriculture or electric grids).

Researchers and engineers: We identify many problems that require conceptual innovation and can
advance the ﬁeld of ML, as well as being highly impactful. For example, we highlight how climate models
afford an exciting domain for interpretable ML (see §7). We encourage researchers and engineers across
ﬁelds to use their expertise in solving urgent problems relevant to society.

Entrepreneurs and investors: We identify many problems where existing ML techniques could have a
major impact without further research, and where the missing piece is deployment. We realize that some of
the recommendations we offer here will make valuable startups and nonproﬁts. For example, we highlight
techniques for providing ﬁne-grained solar forecasts for power companies (see §1.1), tools for helping re-
duce personal energy consumption (see §10.2), and predictions for the ﬁnancial impacts of climate change
(see §13). We encourage entrepreneurs and investors to ﬁll what is currently a wide-open space.

Corporate leaders: We identify problems where ML can lead to massive efﬁciency gains if adopted at
scale by corporate players. For example, we highlight means of optimizing supply chains to reduce waste
(see §4.1) and software/hardware tools for precision agriculture (see §5.2). We encourage corporate leaders
to take advantage of opportunities offered by ML to beneﬁt both the world and the bottom line.

Local and national governments: We identify problems where ML can improve public services, help
gather data for decision-making, and guide plans for future development. For example, we highlight intel-
ligent transportation systems (see §2.4), techniques for automatically assessing the energy consumption of
buildings in cities (see §3.1), and tools for improving disaster management (see §8.4). We encourage gov-
ernments to consult ML experts while planning infrastructure and development, as this can lead to better,
more cost-effective outcomes. We further encourage public entities to release data that may be relevant to
climate change mitigation and adaptation goals.

Table 1: Climate change solution domains, corresponding to sections of this paper, matched with selected
areas of ML that are relevant to each.

How to read this paper

The paper is broken into sections according to application domain (see Table 1). To help the reader, we have
also included the following ﬂags at the level of individual strategies.

• High Leverage denotes bottlenecks that domain experts have identiﬁed in climate change mitigation
or adaptation and that we believe to be particularly well-suited to tools from ML. These areas may be
especially fruitful for ML practitioners wishing to have an outsized impact, though applications not
marked with this ﬂag are also valuable and should be pursued.

• Long-term denotes applications that will have their primary impact after 2040. While extremely
important, these may in some cases be less pressing than those which can help act on climate change
in the near term.

• Uncertain Impact denotes applications where the impact on GHG emissions is uncertain (for exam-
ple, the Jevons paradox may apply3) or where there is potential for undesirable side effects (negative
externalities).

These ﬂags should not be taken as deﬁnitive; they represent our understanding of more rigorous analyses
within the domains we consider, combined with our subjective evaluation of the potential role of ML in these
various applications.

Despite the length of the paper, we cannot cover everything. There will certainly be many applications
that we have not considered, or that we have erroneously dismissed. We look forward to seeing where future
work leads.

A call for collaboration

All of the problems we highlight in this paper require collaboration across ﬁelds. As the language used to re-
fer to problems often varies between disciplines, we have provided keywords and background reading within
each section of the paper. Finding collaborators and relevant data can sometimes be difﬁcult; for additional
resources, please visit the website that accompanies this paper: https://www.climatechange.ai/.
Collaboration makes it easier to develop effective strategies. Working with domain experts reduces the
chance of using powerful tools when simple tools will do the job, of working on a problem that isn’t actually
relevant to practitioners, of overly simplifying a complex issue, or of failing to anticipate risks.

Collaboration can also help ensure that new work reaches the audience that will use it. To be impactful,
ML code should be accessible and published using a language and a platform that are already popular with
the intended users. For maximal impact, new code can be integrated into an existing, widely used tool.

We emphasize that machine learning is not a silver bullet. The applications we highlight are impactful,
but no one solution will “ﬁx” climate change. There are also many areas of action where ML is inapplicable,
and we omit these entirely. Furthermore, technology alone is not enough – technologies that would address
climate change have been available for years, but have largely not been adopted at scale by society. While
we hope that ML will be useful in reducing the costs associated with climate action, humanity also must
decide to act.

3The Jevons paradox in economics refers to a situation where increased efﬁciency nonetheless results in higher overall demand.
For example, autonomous vehicles could cause people to drive far more, so that overall GHG emissions could increase even if each
ride is more efﬁcient. In such cases, it becomes especially important to make use of speciﬁc policies, such as carbon pricing, to
direct new technologies and the ML behind them. See also the literature on rebound effects and induced demand.

Mitigation

1 Electricity Systems

by Priya L. Donti

AI has been called the new electricity, given its potential to transform entire industries [17]. Interestingly,
electricity itself is one of the industries that AI is poised to transform. Many electricity systems are awash
in data, and the industry has begun to envision next-generation systems (smart grids) driven by AI and ML
[18–20].

Electricity systems4 are responsible for about a quarter of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions each
year [26]. Moreover, as buildings, transportation, and other sectors seek to replace GHG-emitting fuels (§2-
3), demand for low-carbon electricity will grow. To reduce emissions from electricity systems, society must

• Rapidly transition to low-carbon5 electricity sources (such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear) and

phase out carbon-emitting sources (such as coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels).

• Reduce emissions from existing CO2-emitting power plants, since the transition to low-carbon power

will not happen overnight.

• Implement these changes across all countries and contexts, as electricity systems are everywhere.

ML can contribute on all fronts by informing the research, deployment, and operation of electricity
system technologies (Fig. 1). Such contributions include accelerating the development of clean energy
technologies, improving forecasts of demand and clean energy, improving electricity system optimization
and management, and enhancing system monitoring. These contributions require a variety of ML paradigms
and techniques, as well as close collaborations with the electricity industry and other experts to integrate
insights from operations research, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, the social sciences, and other
ﬁelds.

1.1 Enabling low-carbon electricity

Low-carbon electricity sources are essential to tackling climate change. These sources come in two forms: vari-
able and controllable. Variable sources ﬂuctuate based on external factors; for instance, solar panels pro-
duce power only when the sun is shining, and wind turbines only when the wind is blowing. On the other
hand, controllable sources such as nuclear or geothermal plants can be turned on and off (though not in-
stantaneously6). These two types of sources affect electricity systems differently, and so present distinct
opportunities for ML techniques.

1.1.1 Variable sources

Most electricity is delivered to consumers using a physical network called the electric grid, where the power
generated must equal the power consumed at every moment. This implies that for every solar panel, wind

4Throughout this section, we use the term “electricity systems” to refer to the procurement of fuels and raw materials for electric
grid components; the generation and storage of electricity; and the delivery of electricity to end-use consumers. For primers on
these topics, see [21–25].

5We use the term “low-carbon” here instead of “renewable” because of this paper’s explicit focus on climate change goals.
Renewable energy is produced from inexhaustible or easily replenished energy sources such as the sun, wind, or water, but need
not necessarily be carbon-free (as in the case of some biomass [27]). Similarly, not all low-carbon energy is renewable (as in the
case of nuclear energy).

6Nuclear power plants are often viewed as inﬂexible since they can take hours or days to turn on or off, and are often left on (at
full capacity) to operate as baseload. That said, nuclear power plants may have some ﬂexibility to change their power generation
for load-following and other electric grid services, as in the case of France [28].

turbine, or other variable electricity generator, there is some mix of natural gas plants, storage, or other
controllable sources ready to buffer changes in its output (e.g. when unexpected clouds block the sun or
the wind blows less strongly than predicted). Today, this buffer is often provided by coal and natural gas
plants run in a CO2-emitting standby mode called spinning reserve. In the future, this role is expected to be
played by energy storage technologies such as batteries (§2.3), pumped hydro, or power-to-gas [29].7 ML
can both reduce emissions from today’s standby generators and enable the transition to carbon-free systems
by helping improve necessary technologies (namely forecasting, scheduling, and control) and by helping
create advanced electricity markets that accommodate both variable electricity and ﬂexible demand.

7It is worth noting that in systems with many fossil fuel plants, storage may increase emissions depending on how it is operated

[30, 31].

Forecasting supply and demand
High Leverage
Since variable generation and electricity demand both ﬂuctuate, they must be forecast ahead of time to in-
form real-time electricity scheduling and longer-term system planning. Better short-term forecasts can allow
system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting standby plants and to proactively manage increasing
amounts of variable sources. Better long-term forecasts can help system operators (and investors) determine
where and when variable plants should be built. While many system operators today use basic forecasting
techniques, forecasts will need to become increasingly accurate, span multiple horizons in time and space,
and better quantify uncertainty to support these use cases. ML can help on all these fronts.

To date, many ML methods have been used to forecast electricity supply and demand. These meth-
ods have employed historical data, physical model outputs, images, and even video data to create short-
to medium-term forecasts of solar power [32–40], wind power [41–45], “run-of-the-river” hydro power
[19], demand [46–49], or more than one of these [50, 51] at aggregate spatial scales. These methods span
various types of supervised machine learning, fuzzy logic, and hybrid physical models, and take different
approaches to quantifying (or not quantifying) uncertainty. At a more spatially granular level, some work
has attempted to understand speciﬁc categories of demand, for instance by clustering households [52, 53]
or by disaggregating electricity signals using game theory, optimization, regression, and/or online learning
[54–56].

While much of this previous work has used domain-agnostic techniques, ML algorithms of the future
will need to incorporate domain-speciﬁc insights. For instance, since weather fundamentally drives both
variable generation and electricity demand, ML algorithms forecasting these quantities should draw from
innovations in climate modeling and weather forecasting (§7) and in hybrid physics-plus-ML modeling tech-
niques [33–35]. Such techniques can help improve short- to medium-term forecasts, and are also necessary
for ML to contribute to longer-term (e.g. year-scale) forecasts since weather distributions shift over time
[57].
In addition to incorporating system physics, ML models should also directly optimize for system
goals [58–60]. For instance, the authors of [58] use a deep neural network to produce demand forecasts
that optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast accuracy; this notion could be extended to
produce forecasts that minimize GHG emissions. In non-automated settings where power system control
engineers (partially) determine how much power each generator should produce, interpretable ML and auto-
mated visualization techniques could help engineers better understand forecasts and thus improve how they
schedule low-carbon generators. More broadly, understanding the domain value of improved forecasts is an
interesting challenge. For example, previous work has characterized the beneﬁts of speciﬁc solar forecast
improvements in a region of the United States [61]; further study in different contexts and for different types
of improvements could help better direct ML work in the forecasting space.

Improving scheduling and ﬂexible demand
When balancing electricity systems, system operators use a process called scheduling and dispatch to de-
termine how much power every controllable generator should produce. This process is slow and complex,
as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such as unit commitment and optimal power ﬂow that
must be coordinated across multiple time scales (from sub-second to days ahead). Further, scheduling will
become even more complex as electricity systems include more storage, variable generators, and ﬂexible
demand, since operators will need to manage even more system components while simultaneously solving
scheduling problems more quickly to account for real-time variations in electricity production. Schedul-
ing processes must therefore improve signiﬁcantly for operators to manage systems with a high reliance on
variable sources.

ML can help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch by speeding up power
system optimization problems and improving the quality of optimization solutions. A great deal of work
primarily in optimization, but also using techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, and fuzzy

7

logic [62], has focused on improving the tractability of power system optimization problems. ML could also
be used to approximate or simplify existing optimization problems [63–65], to ﬁnd good starting points for
optimization [66], or to learn from the actions of power system control engineers [67]. Dynamic scheduling
[68, 69] and safe reinforcement learning could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact,
some electricity system operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales.

While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has examined how to
(at least partially) decentralize scheduling and dispatch using energy storage, ﬂexible demand, low-carbon
generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid. One strategy is to explicitly design local
control algorithms; for instance, recent work has controlled energy storage and solar inverters using super-
vised learning techniques trained on historical optimization data [70–73]. Another strategy is to let storage,
demand, and generation respond to real-time prices8 that reﬂect (for example) how emissions-intensive elec-
tricity currently is. In this case, ML can help both to design real-time prices and to respond to these prices.
Previous work has used dynamic programming to set real-time electricity prices [78] and reinforcement
learning to set real-time prices in more general settings [79]; similar techniques could be applied to create
prices that instead optimize for GHG emissions. Techniques such as agent-based models [80–83], online
optimization [84], and dynamic programming [85] can then help maximize proﬁts for decentralized storage,
demand, and generation, given real-time prices. In general, much more work is needed to test and scale
existing decentralized solutions; barring deployment on real systems, platforms such as PowerTAC [86] can
provide large-scale simulated electricity markets on which to perform these tests.

Accelerating materials science
High Leverage Long-term
Scientists are working to develop new materials that can better store or otherwise harness energy from vari-
able natural resources. For instance, creating solar fuels (synthetic fuels produced from sunlight or solar
heat) could allow us to capture solar energy when the sun is shining and then store this energy for later use.
However, the process of discovering new materials can be slow and imprecise; the physics behind materials
are not completely understood, so human experts often manually apply heuristics to understand a proposed
material’s physical properties [87, 88]. ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics
with experimental data, physics, and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge. For
instance, recent work has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics to ﬁgure out a proposed ma-
terial’s crystal structure, with the goal of accelerating materials discovery for solar fuels [88–90]. Other
work seeking to improve battery storage technologies has combined ﬁrst-principles physics calculations
with support-vector regression to design conducting solids for lithium-ion batteries [91]. (Additional appli-
cations of ML to batteries are discussed in §2.3.)

More generally in materials science, ML techniques including supervised learning, active learning, and
generative models have been used to help synthesize, characterize, model, and design materials, as described
in reviews [87, 92] and more recent work [93]. As discussed in [87], novel challenges for ML in materials
science include coping with moderately sized datasets and inferring physical principles from trained models
In addition to advancing technology, ML can inform policy for accelerated materials science; for
[94].
instance, previous work has applied natural language processing to patent data to understand the solar panel
innovation process [95]. We note that while our focus here has been on electricity system applications, ML
for accelerated science may also have signiﬁcant impacts outside electricity systems, e.g. by helping design
alternatives to cement (§4.2) or create better CO2 sorbents (§6.1).

Additional applications
There are many additional opportunities for ML to advance variable power generation. For instance, it
is important to ensure that low-carbon variable generators produce energy as efﬁciently and proﬁtably as

possible. Prior work has attempted to maximize electricity production by controlling movable solar panels
[96, 97] or wind turbine blades [98] using reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization. Other work has
used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels [99] and genetic algorithms to optimally place
wind turbines within a wind farm [100]. ML can also help control batteries located at solar and wind farms
to increase these farms’ proﬁts, for instance by storing their electricity when prices are low and then selling
it when prices are high; prior work has used ML to forecast electricity prices [101, 102] or reinforcement
learning to control batteries based on current and historical prices [103].

ML can also help integrate rooftop solar panels into the electric grid, particularly in the United States and
Europe. Rooftop solar panels are connected to a part of the electric grid called the distribution grid, which
traditionally did not have many sensors because it was only used to deliver electricity “one-way” from
centralized power plants to consumers. However, rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources have
created a “two-way” ﬂow of electricity on distribution grids. Since the locations and sizes of rooftop solar
panels are often unknown to electricity system operators, previous work has used computer vision techniques
on satellite imagery to generate size and location data for rooftop solar panels [104, 105]. Further, to ensure
that the distribution system runs smoothly, recent work has employed techniques such as matrix completion
and deep neural networks to estimate the state of the system when there are few sensors [106–108].

1.1.2 Controllable sources

Controllable low-carbon electricity sources can help achieve climate change goals while requiring very few
changes to how the electric grid is run (since today’s fossil fuel power plants are also controllable). ML can
support existing controllable technologies while accelerating the development of new technologies such as
nuclear fusion power plants.

Managing existing technologies
Many controllable low-carbon technologies are already commercially available; these technologies include
geothermal, nuclear ﬁssion, and (in some cases9) dam-based hydropower. ML can provide valuable input in
planning where these technologies should be deployed and can also help maintain already-operating power
plants. For instance, recent work has proposed to use ML to identify and manage sites for geothermal energy,
using satellite imagery and seismic data [110]. Previous work has also used multi-objective optimization to
place hydropower dams in a way that satisﬁes both energy and ecological objectives [111]. Finally, ML can
help maintain nuclear ﬁssion reactors (i.e., nuclear power plants) by detecting cracks and anomalies from
image and video data [112] or by preemptively detecting faults from high-dimensional sensor and simulation
data [113]. (The authors of [114] speculate that ML and high performance computing could also be used to
help simulate nuclear waste disposal options or even design next-generation nuclear reactors.)

Accelerating fusion science
High Leverage Long-term
Nuclear fusion reactors [115] have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free electricity using a virtu-
ally limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy than they produce [116]. While
considerable scientiﬁc and engineering research is still needed, ML can help accelerate this work by guid-
ing experimental design and monitoring physical processes. Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental
design because they have a large number of tunable parameters; ML can help prioritize which parameter con-
ﬁgurations should be explored during physical experiments. For instance, Google and TAE Technologies
have developed a human-in-the-loop experimental design algorithm enabling rapid parameter exploration
for TAE’s reactor [117].

9Dam-based hydropower may produce methane, primarily due to biomass that decomposes when a hydro reservoir ﬂoods, but

the amount produced varies between power plants [109].

9

Physically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML. Modern reactors attempt
to super-heat hydrogen into a plasma state and then stabilize it, but during this process, the plasma may
experience rapid instabilities that damage the reactor. Prior work has tried to preemptively detect disruptions
for tokamak reactors, using supervised learning methods such as support-vector machines, adaptive fuzzy
logic, decision trees, and deep learning [118–123] on previous disruption data. While many of these methods
are tuned to work on individual reactors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights that
generalize to multiple reactors [123]. More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists
need to understand how plasma’s state evolves over time, e.g. by ﬁnding the solutions of time-dependent
magnetohydrodynamic equations [124]; speculatively, ML could help characterize this evolution and even
help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. ML models for such fusion applications would
likely employ a combination of simulated10 and experimental data, and would need to account for the
different physical characteristics, data volumes, and simulator speeds or accuracies associated with different
reactor types.

1.2 Reducing current-system impacts

While switching to low-carbon electricity sources will be essential, in the meantime, it will also be important
to mitigate emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands. Some methods for mitigating current-
system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels, reducing waste from electricity delivery, and
ﬂexibly managing demand to minimize its emissions impacts.

Reducing life-cycle fossil fuel emissions
High Leverage Uncertain Impact
Reducing emissions from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions towards low-carbon
electricity. In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane (an extremely potent greenhouse gas)
from natural gas pipelines and compressor stations. Previous and ongoing work has used sensor and/or
satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance [131, 132] or detect existing leaks [133–135], and
there is a great deal of opportunity in this space to improve and scale existing strategies. In addition to leak
detection, ML can help reduce emissions from freight transportation of solid fuels (§2), identify and manage
storage sites for CO2 sequestered from power plant ﬂue gas (§6.2), and optimize power plant parameters to
reduce CO2 emissions. In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great care so as not to impede
or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity system; ideally, projects should be preceded by system
impact analyses to ensure that they will indeed decrease GHG emissions.

Reducing system waste
As electricity gets transported from generators to consumers, some of it gets lost as resistive heat on electric-
ity lines. While some of these losses are unavoidable, others can be signiﬁcantly mitigated to reduce waste
and emissions. ML can help prevent avoidable losses through predictive maintenance, i.e., by suggesting
proactive electricity grid upgrades. Prior work has performed predictive maintenance using LSTMs [136],
bipartite ranking [137], and neural network-plus-clustering techniques [138] on electric grid data, and future
work will need to improve and/or localize these approaches to different contexts.

Modeling emissions
Flexibly managing household, commercial, industrial, and electric vehicle demand (as well as energy stor-
age) can help minimize electricity-based emissions (§2, 3, 4, 10), but doing so involves understanding what
the emissions on the electric grid actually are at any moment. Speciﬁcally, marginal emissions factors

[129], and IPS [130].

capture the emissions effects of small changes in demand at any given time. To inform consumers about
marginal emissions factors, WattTime [139] estimates these factors in real time for the United States using
regression-based techniques, and the electricityMap project [140] provides multi-day forecasts for Europe
using ensemble models on electricity and weather data. Great Britain’s National Grid ESO also uses en-
semble models to forecast average emissions factors, which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of
all power plants [141]. There is still much room to improve the performance of these methods, as well as to
forecast related quantities such as electricity curtailments (i.e. the wasting of usually low-carbon electricity
for grid balancing purposes). As most existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important
to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed decrease (rather
than increase) emissions.

1.3 Ensuring global impact

Much of the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such as the United States with
near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data. However, many places that do not share these
attributes are still integral to tackling climate change [26] and warrant serious consideration. To ensure
global impact, ML can help improve electricity access and translate electricity system insights from high-
data to low-data contexts.

Improving clean energy access
Improving access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously improving social and
economic development [142, 143]. Speciﬁcally, clean electricity provided via electric grids, microgrids,
or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators, wood-burning stoves, and other carbon-emitting energy
sources. Figuring out what clean electriﬁcation methods are best for different areas can require intensive,
boots-on-the-ground surveying work, but ML can help provide input to this process in a scalable manner.
For instance, previous work has used image processing, clustering, and optimization techniques on satellite
imagery to inform electriﬁcation initiatives [144]. ML and statistics can also help operate rural microgrids
through accurate forecasts of demand and power production [145, 146], since small microgrids are even
harder to balance than country-scale electric grids. Generating data to aid energy access policy and better
managing energy access strategies are therefore two areas in which ML may have promising applications.

Approaching low-data settings
High Leverage
While ML methods have often been applied to grids with widespread sensors, system operators in many
countries do not collect or share system data. Although these data availability practices may evolve, it
may meanwhile be beneﬁcial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning to translate insights from
high-data to low-data settings (especially since all electric grids share the same underlying system physics).
Developing data-efﬁcient ML techniques will likely also be useful in low-data settings; for instance, in
[147], the authors enforce physical or other domain-speciﬁc constraints on weakly supervised ML models,
allowing these models to learn from very little labeled data.

ML can also help generate information within low-data settings. For instance, recent work has esti-
mated the layout of electricity grids in regions where they are not explicitly mapped, using computer vision
on satellite imagery along with graph search techniques [148]. Companies have also proposed to use satel-
lite imagery to measure power plant CO2 emissions [149] (also see §5.1). Other recent work has modeled
electricity consumption using regression-based techniques on cellular network data [150], which may prove
useful in settings with many cellular towers but few electric grid sensors. Although low-data settings are
generally underexplored by the ML community, electricity systems research in these settings presents op-
portunities for both innovative ML and climate change mitigation.

11

1.4 Discussion

Data-driven and critical to climate change, electricity systems hold many opportunities for ML. At the
same time, applications in this space hold many potential pitfalls; for instance, innovations that seek to
reduce GHG emissions in the oil and gas industries could actually increase emissions by making them
cheaper to emit [20]. Given these domain-speciﬁc nuances, working in this area requires close collaborations
with electricity system decision-makers and with practitioners in ﬁelds including electrical engineering, the
natural sciences, and the social sciences. Interpretable ML may enable stakeholders outside ML to better
understand and apply models in real-world settings. Similarly, it will be important to develop hybrid ML
models that explicitly account for system physics (see e.g. [147, 151–153]), directly optimize for domain-
speciﬁc goals [58–60], or otherwise incorporate or scale existing domain knowledge. Finally, since most
modern electric grids are not data-abundant (although they may be data-driven), understanding how to apply
data-driven insights to these grids may be the next grand challenge for ML in electricity systems.

2 Transportation

by Lynn H. Kaack

Transportation systems form a complex web that is fundamental to an active and prosperous society. Glob-
ally, the transportation sector accounts for about a quarter of energy-related CO2 emissions [4]. In contrast
to the electricity sector, however, transportation has not made signiﬁcant progress to lower its CO2 emissions
[154] and much of the sector is regarded as hard to decarbonize [155]. This is because of the high energy
density of fuels required for many types of vehicles, which constrains low-carbon alternatives, and because
transport policies directly impact end-users and are thus more likely to be controversial.

Passenger and freight transportation are each responsible for about half of transport GHG emissions
[156]. Both freight and passengers can travel by road, by rail, by water, or by air (referred to as transport
modes). Different modes carry vastly different carbon emission intensities.11 At present, more than two-
thirds of transportation emissions are from road travel [156], but air travel has the highest emission intensity
and is responsible for an increasingly large share. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions12 from transportation
include [156]:

• Reducing transport activity.

• Improving vehicle efﬁciency.

• Alternative fuels and electriﬁcation.

• Modal shift (shifting to lower-carbon options, like rail).

Each of these mitigation strategies offers opportunities for ML (Fig. 2). While many of us probably
think of autonomous vehicles and ride-sharing when we think of transport and ML, these technologies have
uncertain impacts on GHG emissions [160], potentially even increasing them. We discuss these disruptive
technologies in §2.1 but show that ML can play a role for decarbonizing transportation that goes much
further. ML can improve vehicle engineering, enable intelligent infrastructure, and provide policy-relevant
information. Many interventions that reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector require changes in
planning, maintenance, and operations of transportation systems, even though the GHG reduction potential
of those measures might not be immediately apparent. ML can help in implementing such interventions, for
example by providing better demand forecasts. Typically, ML strategies are most effective in tandem with
strong public policies. While we do not cover all ML applications in the transportation sector, we aim to
include those areas that can conceivably reduce GHG emissions.

2.1 Reducing transport activity

A colossal amount of transport occurs each day across the world, but much of this mileage occurs inefﬁ-
ciently, resulting in needless GHG emissions. With the help of ML, the number of vehicle-miles traveled can
be reduced by making long trips less necessary, increasing loading, and optimizing vehicle routing. Here,
we discuss the ﬁrst two in depth – for a discussion of ML and routing, see for example [161].

Understanding transportation data
Many areas of transportation lack data, and decision-makers often design infrastructure and policy with un-
certain information. In recent years, new types of sensors have become available, and ML can turn this raw
data into useful information. Traditionally, trafﬁc is monitored with ground-based counters that are installed
on selected roads. A variety of technologies are used, such as inductive loop detectors or pneumatic tubes.

11Carbon intensity is measured in grams of CO2-equivalent per person-km or per ton-km, respectively.
12For general resources on how to decarbonize the transportation sector, see the AR5 chapter on transportation [156], and [157–

159].

13

Figure 2: Selected strategies to mitigate GHG emissions from transportation using machine learning.

Trafﬁc is sometimes monitored with video systems, in particular when counting pedestrians and cyclists,
which can be automated with computer vision [162]. Since counts on most roads are often available only
over short time frames, these roads are modeled by looking at known trafﬁc patterns for similar roads. ML
methods, such as SVMs and neural networks, have made it easier to classify roads with similar trafﬁc pat-
terns [163–165]. As ground-based counters require costly installation and maintenance, many countries do
not have such systems. Vehicles can also be detected in high-resolution satellite images with high accuracy
[166–169], and image counts can serve to estimate average vehicle trafﬁc [170]. Similarly, ML methods can
help with imputing missing data for precise bottom-up estimation of GHG emissions [171] and they are also
applied in simulation models of vehicle emissions [172].

Modeling demand
High Leverage
Modeling demand and planning new infrastructure can signiﬁcantly shape how long trips are and which
transport modes are chosen by passengers and shippers – for example, discouraging sprawl and creating new
transportation links can both reduce GHG emissions. ML can provide information about mobility patterns,
which is directly necessary for agent-based travel demand models, one of the main transport planning tools
[173]. For example, ML makes it possible to estimate origin-destination demand from trafﬁc counts [174],
and it offers new methods for spatio-temporal road trafﬁc forecasting – which do not always outperform
other statistical methods [175] but may transfer well between areas [176]. Also, short-term forecasting of
public transit ridership can improve with ML; see for example [177, 178]. ML is particularly relevant for
deducing information from novel data – for example, learning about the behavior of public transit users from
smart card data [179, 180]. Also, mobile phone sensors provide new means to understand personal travel
demand and the urban topology, such as walking route choices [181]. Similarly, ML-based modeling of

14

demand can help mitigate climate change by improving operational efﬁciency of modes that emit signiﬁcant
CO2, such as aviation. ML can help predict runway demand and aircraft taxi time in order to reduce the
excess fuel burned in the air and on the ground due to congestion in airports [182, 183].

Shared mobility
Uncertain Impact
In the passenger sector, shared mobility (such as on-demand ride services or vehicle-sharing13), is undoubt-
edly disrupting the way people travel and think about vehicle ownership, and ML plays an integral part in
optimizing these services (e.g. [184]). However, it is largely unclear what the impact of this development
will be. For example, shared cars can actually cause more people to travel by car, as opposed to using
public transportation. Similarly, on-demand taxi services add mileage when traveling without a customer,
possibly negating any GHG emission savings [185]. On the other hand, shared mobility can lead to higher
utilization of each vehicle, which means a more efﬁcient use of materials [186]. The use of newer and
more efﬁcient vehicles, ideally electric ones, could increase with vehicle-sharing concepts, reducing GHG
emissions. Some of the issues raised above could also perhaps be overcome by making taxis autonomous.
Such vehicles also might integrate better with public transportation, and offer new concepts for pooled rides,
which substantially reduce the emissions per person-mile.

ML methods can help to understand the energy impact of shared mobility concepts. For example, they
can be used to predict if a customer decides to share a ride with other passengers from an on-demand ride ser-
vice [187]. For decision-makers it is important to have access to timely location-speciﬁc empirical analysis
to understand if a ride share service is taking away customers from low-carbon transit modes and increasing
the use of cars. Some local governments are beginning to require data-sharing from these providers (see
§3.3).

Car-sharing services using autonomous vehicles could yield GHG emission savings when they encour-
age people to use public transit for part of the journey [188] or with autonomous electric vehicles [189].
However, using autonomous shared vehicles alone could increase the total vehicle-miles traveled and there-
fore do not necessarily lead to lower emissions as long as the vehicles have internal combustion engines
(or electrical engines on a “dirty” electrical grid) [190, 191]. We see the intersection of shared mobility,
autonomous and electric vehicles, and smart public transit as a path where ML can make a contribution to
shaping future mobility. See also §2.2 for more on autonomous vehicles.

When designing and promoting new mobility services, it is important that industry and public policy
prioritize lowering GHG emissions. Misaligned incentives in the early stages of technological development
could result in the lock-in to a service with high GHG emissions [192, 193].

Freight routing and consolidation
High Leverage
Bundling shipments together, which is referred to as freight consolidation, dramatically reduces the number
of trips (and therefore the GHG emissions). The same is true for changing routing so that trucks do not
have to return empty. As rail and water modes require much larger loads than trucks, consolidation also
enables shipments to use these modes for part of the journey [159]. Freight consolidation and routing de-
cisions are often taken by third-party logistics service providers and other freight forwarders, such as in the
less-than-truckload market, which deals with shipments of smaller sizes. ML offers opportunities to opti-
mize this complex interaction of shipment sizes, modes, origin-destination pairs, and service requirements.
Many problem settings are addressed with methods from the ﬁeld of operations research. There is evidence
that ML can improve upon these methods, in particular mixed-integer linear programming [194]. Other
proposed and deployed applications of ML include predicting arrival times or demand, identifying and plan-
ning around transportation disruptions [195], and clustering suppliers by their geographical location and
common shipping destinations. Proposed planning approaches include designing allocation algorithms and

13In this section, we discuss shared cars; see §2.4 for bike shares and electric scooters.

15

freight auctions, and ML has for example been shown to help pick good algorithms and parameters to solve
auction markets [196].

Alternatives to transport
Uncertain Impact
Disruptive technologies that are based on ML could replace or reduce transportation demand. For example,
additive manufacturing (AM, or 3-D printing) has (limited) potential to reduce freight transport by producing
lighter goods and enabling production closer to the consumer [159]. ML can be a valuable tool for improving
AM processes [197]. ML can also help to improve virtual communication [198]. If passenger trips are
replaced by telepresence, travel demand can be reduced, as has been shown for example in public agencies
[199] and for scientiﬁc teams [200]. However, it is uncertain to what extent virtual meetings replace physical
travel, or if they may actually give rise to more face-to-face meetings [201].

2.2

Improving vehicle efﬁciency

Most vehicles are not very efﬁcient compared to what is technically possible: for example, aircraft car-
bon intensity is expected to decline by more than a third with respect to 2012, simply by virtue of newer
models replacing aging jets [202]. Both the design of the vehicle and the way it is operated can increase
the fuel economy. Here, we discuss how ML can help design more efﬁcient vehicles and the impacts that
autonomous driving may have on GHG emissions. Encouraging drivers to adopt more efﬁcient vehicles is
also a priority; while we do not focus on this here, ML plays a role in studying consumer preferences in
vehicle markets [203].

Designing for efﬁciency
There are many ways to reduce the energy a vehicle uses – such as more efﬁcient engines, improved aero-
dynamics, hybrid electric engines, and reducing the vehicle’s weight or tire resistance. These different
strategies require a broad range of engineering techniques, many of which can beneﬁt from ML. For exam-
ple, ML is applied in advanced combustion engine design [204]. Hybrid electric vehicles, which are more
efﬁcient than combustion engines alone, rely on power management methods that can be improved with
ML [205]. Aerodynamic efﬁciency improvements need turbulence modeling that is often computationally
intensive and relies heavily on ML-based surrogate models [206]. Aerodynamic improvements can not only
be made by vehicle design but also by rearranging load. Lai et al. [207] use computer vision to detect
aerodynamically inefﬁcient loading on freight trains. Additive manufacturing (3-D printing) can produce
lighter parts in vehicles, such as road vehicles and aircraft, that reduce energy consumption [159, 186]. ML
is applied to improve those processes, for example through failure detection [208, 209] or material design
[210].

Autonomous vehicles
Uncertain Impact
Machine learning is essential in the development of autonomous vehicles (AVs), including in such basic
tasks as following the road and detecting obstacles [211].14 While AVs could reduce energy consumption –
for example, by reducing trafﬁc congestion and inducing efﬁciency through eco-driving – it is also possible
that AVs will lead to an increase in overall road trafﬁc that nulliﬁes efﬁciency gains. (For an overview of
possible energy impacts of AVs see [160, 212] and for broader impacts on mobility see [213].) Two advan-
tages of AVs in the freight sector promise to cut GHG emissions: First, small autonomous vehicles, such as
delivery robots and drones, could reduce the energy consumption of last-mile delivery [214], though they
come with regulatory challenges [215]. Second, trucks can reduce energy consumption by platooning (driv-
ing very close together to reduce air resistance), thereby alleviating some of the challenges that come with

14Providing details on the general role of ML for AVs is beyond the scope of this paper.

16

electrifying long-distance road freight [216]. Platooning relies on autonomous driving and communication
technologies that allow vehicles to brake and accelerate simultaneously.

ML can help to develop AV technologies speciﬁcally aimed at reducing energy consumption. For ex-
ample, Wu et al. [217, 218] develop AV controllers based on reinforcement learning to smooth out trafﬁc
involving non-autonomous vehicles, reducing congestion-related energy consumption. ML methods can
also help to understand driving practices that are more energy efﬁcient. For example, Jim´enez et al. [219]
use data from smart phone sensors to identify driving behavior that leads to higher energy consumption in
electric vehicles.

2.3 Alternative fuels and electriﬁcation

Electric vehicles
High Leverage
Electric vehicle (EV) technologies – using batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, or electriﬁed roads and railways
– are regarded as a primary means to decarbonize transport. EVs can have very low GHG emissions – de-
pending, of course, on the carbon intensity of the electricity. ML is vital for a range of different problems
related to EVs. Rigas et al. [220] detail methods by which ML can improve charge scheduling, congestion
management, and vehicle-to-grid algorithms. ML methods have also been applied to battery energy man-
agement (for example charge estimation [221] or optimization in hybrid EVs [205]), and to detect faults and
lateral misalignment in wireless charging of EVs [222].

As more people drive EVs, understanding their use patterns will become more important. Modeling
charging behavior will be useful for grid operators looking to predict electric load. For this application, it is
possible to analyze residential EV charging behavior from aggregate electricity load (energy disaggregation,
see also §3.1) [223]. Also, in-vehicle sensors and communication data are increasingly becoming available
and offer an opportunity to understand travel and charging behavior of EV owners, which can for example
inform the placement of charging stations [224].

Battery electric vehicles are typically not used for more than a fraction of the day, allowing them to act as
energy storage for the grid at other times, where charging and discharging is controlled for example by price
signals [225] (see §1.1.1,1.2). There is much potential for ML to improve such vehicle-to-grid technology,
for example with reinforcement learning [226], which can reduce GHG emissions from electricity genera-
tion. Vehicle-to-grid technology comes with private and social ﬁnancial beneﬁts. However, consumers are
expected to be reluctant to agree to such services, as they might not want to compromise their driving range
[227].

Finally, ML can also play a role in the research and development of batteries, a decisive technology
for EV costs and usability. Work in this area has focused on predicting battery state, degradation, and
remaining lifetime using supervised learning techniques, fuzzy logic, and clustering [228–235]. However,
many models developed in academia are based on laboratory data that do not account for real-world factors
such as environmental conditions [228–230]. By contrast, industry lags behind in ML modeling, but real-
world operational data are readily available. Merging these two perspectives could yield signiﬁcant beneﬁts
for the ﬁeld.

Alternative fuels
Long-term
Much of the transportation sector is highly dependent on liquid fossil fuels. Aviation, long-distance road
transportation, and ocean shipping require fuels with high energy density and thus are not conducive to
electriﬁcation [155]. Electrofuels [236], solar fuels 1.1.1, biofuels [237], hydrogen [238, 239], and perhaps
natural gas [240] offer alternatives, but the use of these fuels is constrained by factors such as cost, land-
use, and (for hydrogen and natural gas) incompatibility with current infrastructure [155]. Electrofuels and
biofuels have the potential to serve as low-carbon drop-in fuels that retain the properties of fossil fuels, such
as high energy density, while retaining compatibility with the existing ﬂeet of vehicles and the current fuel

17

infrastructure [159]. Fuels such as electrofuels and hydrogen can be produced using electricity-intensive
processes and can be stored at lower cost than electricity. Thus, as a form of energy storage, these fuels
could provide services to the electricity grid by enabling ﬂexible power use and balancing variable electricity
generators (§1.1.1). Given their relative long-term importance and early stage of development, they present
a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change. ML techniques may present opportunities for improvement
at various stages of research and development of alternative fuels (similar to applications in §1.1.1).

2.4 Modal shift

Shifting passengers and freight to low carbon-intensity modes is one of the most important means to decar-
bonize transport. This modal shift in passenger transportation can for example involve providing people with
public transit, which requires analyzing mode choice and travel demand data. ML can also make low-carbon
freight modes more competitive by helping to coordinate intermodal transport.

Passenger preferences
ML can improve our understanding about passengers’ travel mode choices, which in turn informs transporta-
tion planning, such as where public transit should be built. Some recent studies have shown that supervised
ML based on survey data can improve passenger mode choice models [241–243]. Seo et al. propose to
conduct long-term travel surveys with online learning, which reduces the demand on respondents, while
obtaining high data quality [244]. Sun et al. [245] use SVMs and neural networks for analyzing preferences
of customers traveling by high speed rail in China. There is also work on inferring people’s travel modes
and destinations from social media or various mobile phone sensors such as GPS (transportation mode de-
tection), e.g. [246, 247]. Also in the freight sector, ML has been applied to analyze modal trade-offs, for
example by imputing data on counterfactual mode choices [248].

Enabling low-carbon options
High Leverage
In order to incentivize more users to choose low-carbon transport modes, their costs and service quality can
be improved. Many low-carbon modes must be integrated with other modes of transportation to deliver the
same level of service. For example, when traveling by train, the trip to and from the station will often be
by car, taxi, bus, or bike. There are many opportunities for ML to facilitate a better integration of modes,
both in the passenger and freight sectors. ML can also help to improve the operation of low-carbon modes,
for example by reducing the operations and maintenance costs of rail [249] and predicting track degradation
[250].

Bike sharing and electric scooter services can offer low-carbon alternatives for urban mobility that do not
require ownership and integrate well with public transportation. ML studies help to understand how usage
patterns for bike stations depend on their immediate urban surroundings [251]. ML can also help solve the
bike sharing rebalancing problem, where shared bikes accumulate in one location and are lacking in other
locations, by improving forecasts of bike demand and inventory [252]. Singla et al. [253] propose a pricing
mechanism based on online learning to provide monetary incentives for bike users to help rebalancing.
By producing accurate travel time estimates, ML can provide tools that help to integrate bike shares with
other modes of transportation [254]. Many emerging bike and scooter sharing services are dockless, which
means that they are parked anywhere in public space and can block sidewalks [255]. ML has been applied
to monitor public sentiment about such bike shares via tweets [256]. ML could also provide tools and
information for regulators to ensure that public space can be used by everyone [257].

Coordination between modes resulting in faster and more reliable transit times could increase the amount
of people or goods traveling on low-carbon modes such as rail. ML algorithms could be applied to make
public transportation faster and easier to use. For example, there is a rich literature exploring ML methods
to predict bus arrival times and their uncertainty [258, 259]. Often freight is packaged so that it can switch

18

between different modes of transport easily. Such intermodal transportation relies on low-carbon modes
such as rail and water for part of the journey [159]. ML can contribute by improving predictions of the
estimated time of arrival (for example of freight trains [260]) or the weight or volume of expected freight
(for example for roll-on/roll-off transport – often abbreviated as Ro-Ro [261]). Intelligent transport systems
of different modes could be combined and enable more efﬁcient multimodal freight transportation [159].

Some modes with high GHG emissions, such as trucks, can be particularly cost-competitive in regions
with lax enforcement of regulation, as they can beneﬁt from overloading and not obeying labor or safety rules
[159]. ML can assist public institutions with enforcing their regulations. For example, image recognition
can help law enforcement detect overloading of trucks [262].

2.5 Discussion

Decarbonizing transport is essential to a low-carbon society, and there are numerous applications where ML
can make an impact. This is because transportation causes a large share of GHG emissions, but reducing
them has been slow and complex. Solutions are likely very technical, are highly dependent on existing
infrastructure, and require detailed understanding of passengers’ and freight companies’ behavior. ML can
help decarbonize transportation by providing data, gaining knowledge from data, planning, and automation.
Moreover, ML is fundamental to shared mobility, AVs, EVs, and smart public transit, which, with the right
incentives, can be used to enable signiﬁcant reductions in GHG emissions.

3 Buildings & Cities

by Nikola Milojevic-Dupont and Lynn H. Kaack

Buildings offer some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing GHG emissions. While the en-
ergy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions [4], a combination
of easy-to-implement ﬁxes and state-of-the-art strategies15 could reduce emissions for existing buildings by
up to 90% [264]. It is possible today for buildings to consume almost no energy [265].16 Many of these
energy efﬁciency measures actually result in overall cost savings [266] and simultaneously yield other ben-
eﬁts, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that
buildings provide – and even while extending them to more people, as climate change will necessitate. For
example, with the changing climate, more people will need access to air conditioning in regions where
deadly heat waves will become common [267, 268].

Two major challenges are heterogeneity and inertia. Buildings vary according to age, construction,
usage, and ownership, so optimal strategies vary widely depending on the context. For instance, buildings
with access to cheap, low-carbon electricity may have less need for expensive features such as intelligent
light bulbs. Buildings also have very long lifespans; thus, it is necessary both to create new, energy-efﬁcient
buildings, and to retroﬁt old buildings to be as efﬁcient as possible [269]. Urban planning and public policy
can play a major role in reducing emissions by providing infrastructure, ﬁnancial incentives, or energy
standards for buildings.17

Machine learning provides critical tools for supporting both building managers and policy makers in
their efforts to reduce GHG emissions (Fig. 3). At the level of building management, ML can help select
strategies that are tailored to individual buildings, and can also contribute to implementing those strategies
via smart control systems (§3.1). At the level of urban planning, ML can be used to gather and make sense
of data to inform policy makers (§3.2). Finally, we consider how ML can help cities as a whole to transition
to low-carbon futures (§3.3).

3.1 Optimizing buildings

In designing new buildings and improving existing ones, there are numerous technologies that can reduce
GHG emissions, often saving money in the process [263–266, 270]. ML can accelerate these strategies by
(i) modeling data on energy consumption and (ii) optimizing energy use (in smart buildings).

Modeling building energy
An essential step towards energy efﬁciency is making sense of the increasing amounts of data produced
by meters and home energy monitors (see for example [271]). This can take the form of energy demand
forecasts for speciﬁc buildings, which are useful for power companies (§1.1.1) and in evaluating building
design and operation strategies [272]. Traditionally, energy demand forecasts are based on models of the
physical structure of a building that are essentially massive thermodynamics computations. ML has the po-
tential to speed up these computations greatly, either by ignoring physical knowledge of the building entirely
[273, 274], by incorporating it into the computation [275], or by learning to approximate the physical model
to reduce the need for expensive simulation (surrogate models) [276]. Learning how to transfer the knowl-
edge gained from modeling one building to another can make it easier to render precise estimations of more

15The IPCC classiﬁes mitigation actions in buildings into four categories: carbon efﬁciency (switching to low-carbon fuels or to
natural refrigerants); energy efﬁciency (reducing energy waste through insulation, efﬁcient appliances, better heating and ventilation,
or other similar measures); system and infrastructure efﬁciency (e.g. passive house standards, urban planning, and district cooling
and heating); and service demand reduction (behavioral and lifestyle changes) [263].

16There are even high-rise buildings, e.g. the Tower Raiffeisen-Holding N ¨O-Vienna ofﬁce, or large university buildings, e.g. the

Technical University also in Vienna, that achieve such performance.

17For example, see the case of New York City, which mandated that building owners collectively reduce their emissions by 40%

by 2040: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/nyregion/nyc-energy-laws.html.

buildings. For instance, Mocanu et al. [277] modeled building load proﬁles with reinforcement learning
and deep belief networks using data on commercial and residential buildings; they then used approximate
reinforcement learning and transfer learning to make predictions about new buildings, enabling the transfer
of knowledge from commercial to residential buildings, and from gas- to power-heated buildings.

Within a single building, understanding which appliances drive energy use (energy disaggregation) is
crucial for targeting efﬁciency measures, and can motivate behavioral changes. Promising ML approaches to
this problem include hidden Markov models [278], sparse coding algorithms for structured prediction [279],
harmonic analysis that picks out the “signatures” of individual appliances [280], and deep neural networks
[281].

To verify the success or failure of energy efﬁciency interventions, statistical ML offers methods for
causal inference. For example, Burlig et al. [282] used Lasso regression on hourly electricity consumption
data from schools in California to ﬁnd that energy efﬁciency interventions fall short of the expected savings.
Such problems could represent a useful application of deep learning methods for counterfactual prediction
[283].

Smart buildings
High Leverage
Intelligent control systems in buildings can decrease the carbon footprint both by reducing the energy con-
sumed and by providing means to integrate lower-carbon sources into the electricity mix [284]. Speciﬁcally,
ML can reduce energy usage by allowing devices and systems to adapt to usage patterns. Further, buildings
can respond to signals from the electricity grid, providing ﬂexibility to the grid operator and lowering costs
to the consumer (§1.1.1).

Many critical systems inside buildings can be made radically more efﬁcient. While this is also true for
small appliances such as refrigerators and lightbulbs, we use the example of heating and cooling (HVAC)
systems, both because they are notoriously inefﬁcient and because they account for more than half of the
energy consumed in buildings [263]. There are several promising ways to enhance HVAC operating per-

21

formance, each providing substantial opportunities for using ML: forecasting what temperatures are needed
throughout the system, better control to achieve those temperatures, and fault detection. Forecasting temper-
atures, as with modeling energy use in buildings, has traditionally been performed using detailed physical
models of the system involved; however, ML approaches such as deep belief networks can potentially in-
crease accuracy with less computational expense [285, 286] (see also §4.3). For control, Kazmi et al. [287]
used deep reinforcement learning to achieve a scalable 20% reduction of energy while requiring only three
sensors: air temperature, water temperature, and energy use (see also §4.3 for similarly substantial gains
in datacenter cooling). Finally, ML can automate building diagnostics and maintenance through fault-
detection. For example, the energy efﬁciency of cooling systems can degrade if refrigerant levels are low
[288]; ML approaches are well-suited to detect faults in these systems. Wang et al. [289] treated HVAC
fault-detection as a one-class classiﬁcation problem, using only temperature readings for their predictions.
Deep autoencoders can be used to simplify information about machine operation so that deep neural net-
works can then more easily predict multiple kinds of faults [290].

Many systems within buildings – such as lights and heating – can also adjust how they operate based
on whether a building or room is occupied, thereby improving both occupant comfort and energy use [291].
ML can help these systems dynamically adapt to changes in occupancy patterns [292]. Moreover, occupancy
detection itself represents an opportunity for ML algorithms, ranging from decision trees [293, 294] to deep
neural networks [295] that take input from occupancy sensors [293], WiFi signals [295, 296], or appliance
power consumption data [294].

In §1.1.1, we discussed how using variable low-carbon energy can mean that the supply and price of
electricity varies over time. Thus, energy ﬂexibility in buildings is increasingly useful to schedule consump-
tion when supply is high [297]. For this, automated demand-side response [298] can respond to electricity
prices, smart meter signals, or learned user preferences [299]. Edge computing can be used to process data
from distributed sensors and other Internet of Things devices, and deep reinforcement learning can then use
this data to efﬁciently schedule energy use [300].

While smart building technologies have the capability to signiﬁcantly increase efﬁciency, we should
note that there are potential drawbacks [301]. First, smart building devices and connection networks, like
wireless sensor networks, consume energy themselves; however, deep neural networks can be used to mon-
itor and optimize their operations [302]. Second, rebound effects are likely to happen in certain cases [303],
leading to additional building energy consumption typically ranging between 10 and 20% [304]. If control
systems optimize for costs, interventions do not necessarily translate into energy efﬁciency measures or
GHG reductions. Therefore, public policies are needed to mandate, support and complement the actions of
individual building managers [263]. Another concern in the case of widespread adoption of smart meters
is the impact on mineral use and embodied energy use arising from their production [305]. Finally, smart
home applications present security and privacy risks [306] that require adequate regulation.

3.2 Urban planning

For many impactful mitigation strategies – such as district heating and cooling, neighborhood planning, and
large-scale retroﬁtting of existing buildings – coordination at the district and city level is essential. Policy
makers use instruments such as building codes, retroﬁtting subsidies, investments in public utilities, and
public-private partnerships in order to reduce GHG emissions without compromising equity. Where energy-
use data on individual buildings exist, ML can be used to derive higher-level patterns. However, many
regions of the world have almost no energy consumption data, which can make it difﬁcult to design tar-
geted mitigation strategies. ML is uniquely capable of predicting energy consumption and GHG mitigation
potential at scale from other types of available data.

22

Modeling energy use across buildings
Urban Building Energy Models provide simpliﬁed information on the energy use of all buildings across a
city. These are different from individual-building models, which model energy use of only speciﬁc buildings,
but with ﬁner details and temporal granularity (§3.1). While UBEMs have yet to be adopted at scale, they
are expected to become fundamental for enabling localized action by city planners [307].18 UBEMs can
for example be used for planning and operating district heating and cooling, where a central plant supplies
many households in a district. In turn, district heating and cooling reduces HVAC energy consumption and
can provide ﬂexible load [309], but it needs large amounts of data at the district level for implementation
and operation.

UBEMs include features such as the location, geometries, and various other attributes of interest like
building footprint, usage, material, roof type, immediate surroundings etc. ML can be used to held predict
energy consumption from such features. For example, Kolter and Ferreira used Gaussian process regression
to predict energy use from features such as property class or the presence of central AC [310]. Based on
energy data disclosed by residents of New York City, Kontokosta and colleagues used various ML methods
to predict the energy use of the city’s 1.1 million buildings [311], analyzed the effect of energy disclosure on
the demand [312], and developed a system for ranking buildings based on energy efﬁciency [313]. Zhang et
al. [314] matched residential energy consumption survey data with public use microdata samples to estimate
residential energy consumption at the neighborhood level. Using ﬁve commonly accessible features of
buildings and climate, Robinson et al. predict commercial building energy use across large American cities
[315].

Beyond energy prediction, buildings’ features can be used by ML algorithms to pinpoint which buildings
have the highest retroﬁt potential. Simple building characteristics and surrounding environmental factors –
both potentially available at scale – can be used [316, 317].

There have also been attempts to upscale individual-building energy models to the district scale. Using
deep neural networks for hybrid ML-physical modelling, Nutkiewicz et al. provided precise energy demand
forecasts that account for inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors for all buildings
on a campus [318].

Gathering infrastructure data
High Leverage
Speciﬁcs about building infrastructure can often be predicted using ML techniques. Remote sensing is
key to inferring infrastructure data [105, 319–323] as satellite data19 present a source of information that
is globally available and largely consistent worldwide. For example, using remote sensing data, Geiß et
al. [325] clustered buildings into types to assess the potential of district heat in a German town.

The resolution of infrastructure data ranges from coarse localization of all buildings at the global scale
[319], to precise 3D reconstruction of a neighborhood [323].
It is possible to produce a global map of
human settlement footprints at meter-level resolution from satellite radar images [319]. For this, Esch et
al. used highly automated learners, which make classiﬁcation at such scale possible by retraining locally.
Segmentation of high-resolution satellite images can now generate exact building footprints at a national
scale [320]. Energy-relevant building attributes, such as the presence of photovoltaic panels, can also be
retrieved from these images [105] (see §1.1.1). To generate 3D models, LiDAR data is often used to retrieve
heights or classify buildings at city scale [321, 322], but its collection is expensive. Recent research showed
that heights can be predicted even without such elevation data, as demonstrated by [326], who predicted
these from real estate records and census data. Studies, which for now are small scale, aim for complete 3D
reconstruction with class labels for different components of buildings [323].

18The startup nam.R is developing a database of all school buildings in France to help inform retroﬁtting decisions, harmonizing

vast amounts of open and proprietary data with ML [308].

19See [324] for a review of different sources of data and deep learning methods for processing them.

3.3 The future of cities

Since most of the resources of the world are ultimately channeled into cities, municipal governments have
a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change. City governments regulate (and sometimes operate) trans-
portation, buildings, and economic activity. They handle such diverse issues as energy, water, waste, crime,
health, and noise. Recently, data and ML have become more common for improving efﬁciency in such areas,
giving rise to the notion of smart city. While the phrase smart city encompasses a wide array of technologies
[327], here we discuss only applications that are relevant to reducing GHG emissions.

Data for smart cities
High Leverage
Increasingly, important aspects of city life come with digital information that can make the city function in
a more coordinated way. Habibzadeh et al. [328] differentiate between hard-sensing, i.e., ﬁxed-location-
dedicated sensors like trafﬁc cameras, and soft-sensing, for example from mobile devices. Hard sensing is
the primary data collection paradigm in many smart city applications, as it is adapted to precisely meet the
application requirements. However, there is a growing volume of data coming from soft sensing, due to the
widespread adoption of personal devices like smartphones that can provide movement data and geotagged
pictures.20 Urban computing [330] is an emerging ﬁeld looking at data analytics in urban spaces, and aiming
to yield insights for data-driven policies. For example, clustering anonymized credit card payments makes
it possible to model different communities and lifestyles – of which the sustainability can be assessed [331].
Jiang et al. provides a review of urban computing from mobile phone traces [332].21 Relevant information
on the urban space can also be learned from social media activity, e.g. on Twitter, as reviewed in [333, 334].
There are, however, numerous challenges in making sense of this wealth of data (see [335]), and privacy
considerations are of paramount importance when collecting or working with many of these data sources.

First, cities need to obtain relevant data on activities that directly or indirectly consume energy. Data
are often proprietary. To obtain these data, the city of Los Angeles now requires all mobility as a service
providers, i.e. vehicle-sharing companies, to use an open-source API. Data on location, use, and condition
of all those vehicles, which can be useful in guiding regulation, are thus transmitted to the city [336]. ML
can also distill information on urban issues related to climate change through web-scraping and text-mining,
e.g. [256]. As discussed above (§3.2), ML can also be used to infer infrastructure data.

Second, smart city applications must transmit high volumes of data in real-time. ML is key to prepro-
cessing large amounts of data in large sensor networks, allowing only what is relevant to be transmitted,
instead of all the raw data that is being collected [337–339]. Similar techniques also help to reduce the
amount of energy consumed during transmission itself [340].

Third, urban policy-making based on intelligent infrastructure faces major challenges with data man-
agement [341]. Smart cities require the integration of multiple large and heterogeneous sources of data, for
which ML can be a valuable tool, which includes data matching [342, 343], data fusion [344], and ensemble
learning [345].

Low-emissions infrastructure
When smart city projects are properly integrated into urban planning, they can make cities more sustainable
and foster low-carbon lifestyles (see [340, 346, 347] for extensive reviews on this topic). Different types of
infrastructure interact, meaning that planning strategies should be coordinated to achieve mitigation goals.
For instance, urban sprawl inﬂuences the energy use from transport, as wider cities tend to be more car-
oriented [348–350]. ML-based analysis has shown that the development of efﬁcient public transportation

20Note that management of any such private data, even if they are anonymized, poses challenges [329].
21See https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/urban-computing/ for more applications of

urban computing.

24

is dependent on both the extent of urban sprawl and the local development around transportation hubs
[351, 352].

Cities can reduce GHG emissions by coordinating between infrastructure sectors and better adapting
services to the needs of the inhabitants. ML and AI can help, for example, to coordinate district heating and
cooling networks, solar power generation, and charging stations for electric vehicles and bikes [347], and
can improve public lighting systems by regulating light intensity based on historical patterns of foot trafﬁc
[353]. Due to inherent variability in energy demand and supply, there is a need for uncertainty estimation,
e.g. using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods or Gaussian processes [347].

Currently, most smart city projects for urban climate change mitigation are implemented in wealthier
regions such as the United States, China, and the EU.22 The literature on city-scale mitigation strategies is
also strongly biased towards the Global North [354], while key mitigation challenges are expected to arise
from the Global South [355]. Infrastructure models described in §3.2 could be used to plan low-carbon
neighborhoods without relying on advanced smart city technologies. To transfer strategies across cities, it
is possible to cluster similar cities based on climate-relevant dimensions [356, 357]. Creutzig et al. [349]
related the energy use of 300 cities worldwide to historical structural factors such as fuel taxes (which have
a strong impact on urban sprawl). Other relevant applications include groupings of transportation systems
[356] using a latent class choice model, or of street networks [357] to identify common patterns in urban
development using hierarchical clustering.

3.4 Discussion

We have shown many different ways that ML can help to reduce GHG emissions from buildings and cities.
A central challenge in this sector is the availability of high-quality data for training the algorithms, which
rarely go beyond main cities or represent the full spectrum of building types. Techniques for obtaining these
data, however, can themselves be an important application for ML (e.g. via computer vision algorithms to
parse satellite imagery). Realizing the potential of data-driven urban infrastructure can advance mitigation
goals while improving the well-being of citizens [264, 269, 358].

4 Industry

by Anna Waldman-Brown

Industrial production, logistics, and building materials are leading causes of difﬁcult-to-eliminate GHG
emissions [155]. Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector spends billions of dollars
annually gathering data on factories and supply chains [359] – aided by improvements in the cost and
accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering mechanisms (such as QR codes and image recognition).
The availability of large quantities of data, combined with affordable cloud-based storage and computing,
indicates that industry may be an excellent place for ML to make a positive climate impact.

ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under the following

circumstances:

• When there is enough accessible, high-quality data around speciﬁc processes or transport routes.

• When ﬁrms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with researchers and

other ﬁrms.

objective functions.

• When aspects of production or shipping can be readily ﬁne-tuned or adjusted, and there are clear

• When ﬁrms’ incentives align with reducing emissions (for example, through efﬁciency gains, regula-

tory compliance, or high GHG prices).

In particular, ML can potentially reduce global emissions (Fig. 4) by helping to streamline supply chains,
improve production quality, predict machine breakdowns, optimize heating and cooling systems, and priori-
tize the use of clean electricity over fossil fuels [360–363]. However, it is worth noting that greater efﬁciency
may increase the production of goods and thus GHG emissions (via the Jevons paradox) unless industrial
actors have sufﬁcient incentives to reduce overall emissions [364].

Figure 4: Selected opportunities to use machine learning to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in industry.

4.1 Optimizing supply chains

In 2006, at least two Scottish seafood ﬁrms ﬂew hundreds of metric tons of shrimp from Scotland to China
and Thailand for peeling, then back to Scotland for sale – because they could save on labor costs [365]. This

26

indicates the complexity of today’s globalized supply chains, i.e., the organizational processes and shipping
networks that are required to bring a product from producer to ﬁnal consumer. ML can help reduce emissions
in supply chains by intelligently predicting supply and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and
optimizing shipping routes. (For details on shipping and delivery optimization, see §2.) However, for many
of these applications to reduce emissions, ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial incentives must also align with climate change
mitigation through carbon pricing or other policy mechanisms.

Reducing overproduction
Uncertain Impact
The production, shipment, and climate-controlled warehousing of excess products is a major source of
industrial GHG emissions, particularly for time-dependent goods such as perishable food or retail goods
that quickly fall out of fashion [366]. Global excess inventory in 2011 amounted to about $8 trillion worth
of goods, according to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals [367]. This excess may be in
part due to mis-estimation of demand, as the same organization noted that corporate sales estimates diverged
from actual sales by an average of 40% [367]. ML may be able to mitigate these issues of overproducing
and/or overstocking goods by improving demand forecasting [368, 369]. For example, the clothing industry
sells an average of only 60% of its wares at full price, but some brands can sell up to 85% due to just-in-time
manufacturing and clever intelligence networks [370]. As online shopping and just-in-time manufacturing
become more prevalent and websites offer more product types than physical storefronts, better demand
forecasts will be needed on a regional level to efﬁciently distribute inventory without letting unwanted
goods travel long distances only to languish in warehouses [371]. Nonetheless, negative side effects can
be signiﬁcant depending on the type of product and regional characteristics; just-in-time manufacturing and
online shopping are often responsible for smaller and faster shipments of goods, mostly on road, that lack
the energy efﬁciency of freight aggregation and slower shipping methods such as rail [371, 372].

Recommender systems
Recommender systems can potentially direct consumers and purchasing ﬁrms toward climate-friendly op-
tions, as long as one can obtain information about GHG emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of some
product. The challenge here lies in hunting down usable data on every relevant material and production
process from metal ore extraction through production, shipping, and eventual use and disposal of a product
[373, 374]. One must also convince companies to share proprietary data to help other ﬁrms learn from best
practices. If these datasets can be acquired, ML algorithms could hypothetically assist in identifying the
cleanest options.

Reducing food waste
High Leverage
Globally, society loses or wastes 1.3 billion metric tons of food each year, which translates to one-third of all
food produced for human consumption [375]. In developing countries, 40% of food waste occurs between
harvest and processing or retail, while over 40% of food waste in industrialized nations occurs at the end of
supply chains, in retail outlets, restaurants, and consumers’ homes [375]. ML can help reduce food waste
by optimizing delivery routes and improving demand forecasting at the point of sale (see §4.1), as well as
improving refrigeration systems [376] (see §4.3). ML can also potentially assist with other issues related
to food waste, such as helping develop sensors to identify when produce is about to spoil, so it can be sold
quickly or removed from a storage crate before it ruins the rest of the shipment [377].

4.2

Improving materials

Climate-friendly construction
High Leverage Long-term
Cement and steel production together account for over 10% of all global GHG emissions [378]; the cement

27

industry alone emits more GHGs than every country except the US and China [379]. ML can help minimize
these emissions by reducing the need for carbon-intensive materials, by transforming industrial processes to
run on low-carbon energy, and even by redesigning the chemistry of structural materials. To reduce the use
of cement and steel, researchers have combined ML with generative design to develop structural products
that require less raw material, thus reducing the resulting GHG emissions [360]. Novel manufacturing
techniques such as 3D printing allow for the production of unusual shapes that use less material but may be
impossible to produce through traditional metal-casting or poured concrete; ML and ﬁnite element modeling
have been used to simulate the physical processes of 3D printing in order to improve the quality of ﬁnished
products [380].

Assuming future advances in materials science, ML research could potentially draw upon open databases
such as the Materials Project [381] and the UCI Machine Learning Repository [382] to invent new, climate-
friendly materials [383]. Using semi-supervised generative models and concrete compression data, for
example, Ge et al. proposed novel, low-emission concrete formulas that could satisfy desired structural
characteristics [382].

Climate-friendly chemicals
High Leverage Long-term
Researchers are also experimenting with supervised learning and thermal imaging systems to rapidly iden-
tify promising catalysts and chemical reactions [384, 385], as described in §1.1.1. Firms are unlikely to
adopt new materials or change existing practices without ﬁnancial incentives, so widespread adoption might
require subsidies for low-carbon alternatives or penalties for high GHG emissions.

Ammonia production for fertilizer use relies upon natural gas to heat up and catalyze the reaction, and
accounts for around 2% of global energy consumption [386]. To develop cleaner ammonia, chemists may
be able to invent electrochemical strategies for lower-temperature ammonia production [386, 387]. Given
the potential of ML for predicting chemical reactions [385], ML may also be able to help with the discovery
of new materials for electrocatalysts and/or proton conductors to facilitate ammonia production.

4.3 Production and energy

ML can potentially assist in reducing overall electricity consumption; streamlining factories’ heating, ven-
tilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems; and redesigning some types of industrial processes to run
on low-carbon energy instead of coal, oil, or gas. Again, the higher the incentives for reducing carbon
emissions, the more likely that ﬁrms will optimize for low-carbon energy use. New factory equipment
can be very expensive to purchase and set up, so ﬁrms’ cost-beneﬁt calculations may dissuade them from
retroﬁtting existing factories to run using low-carbon electricity or to save a few kilowatts [388–390]. Given
the heterogeneity across industrial sectors and the secrecy of industrial data, ﬁrms will also need to tailor
the requisite sensors and data analysis systems to their individual processes. ML will become a much more
viable option for industry when factory workers can identify, develop, implement, and monitor their own
solutions internally instead of relying upon outside experts [391]. The ML community can assist by building
accessible, customizable industry tools tailored for people without a strong background in data science.

Adaptive control
High Leverage
On the production side, ML can potentially improve the efﬁciency of HVAC systems and other indus-
trial control mechanisms—given necessary data about all relevant processes. To reduce GHG emissions
from HVAC systems, researchers have suggested combining optimization-based control algorithms with
ML techniques such as image recognition, regression trees, and time delay neural networks [392, 393] (see
also 3.1). DeepMind has used reinforcement learning to optimize cooling centers for Google’s internal
servers by predicting and optimizing the power usage effectiveness (PUE), thus lowering HFC emissions
and reducing cooling costs [361, 394]. Deep neural networks could also be used for adaptive control in

28

a variety of industrial networking applications [395], enabling energy savings through self-learning about
devices’ surroundings.

Predictive maintenance
ML could also contribute to predictive maintenance by more accurately modelling the wear and tear of
machinery that is currently in use, and interpretable ML could assist factory owners in developing a better
understanding of how best to minimize GHG emissions for speciﬁc equipment and processes. For example,
creating a digital twin model of some industrial equipment or process could enable a manufacturer to identify
and prevent undesirable scenarios, as well as virtually test out a new piece of code before uploading it to
the actual factory ﬂoor – thus potentially increasing the GHG efﬁciency of industrial processes [396, 397].
Digital twins can also reduce production waste by identifying broken or about-to-break machines before the
actual factory equipment starts producing damaged products. Industrial systems can employ similar models
to predict which pipes are liable to spring leaks, in order to minimize the direct release of GHGs such as
HFCs and natural gas.

Using cleaner electricity
High Leverage
ML may be particularly useful for enabling more ﬂexible operation of industrial electrical loads, through op-
timizing a ﬁrm’s demand response to electricity prices as addressed in §1. Such optimization can contribute
to cutting GHG emissions as long as ﬁrms have a ﬁnancial incentive to optimize for minimal emissions,
maximal low-carbon energy, or minimum overall power usage. Demand response optimization algorithms
can help ﬁrms adjust the timing of energy-intensive processes such as cement crushing [362] and powder-
coating [398] to take advantage of electricity price ﬂuctuations, although published work on the topic has to
date used relatively little ML. Online algorithms for optimizing demand response can reduce overall power
usage for computer servers by dynamically shifting the internet trafﬁc load of data providers to underutilized
servers, although most of this research, again, has focused on minimizing costs rather than GHG emissions
[84, 399]. Berral et al. proposed a framework that demonstrates how such optimization algorithms might be
combined with RL, digitized controls, and feedback systems to enable the autonomous control of industrial
processes [363].

4.4 Discussion

Given the globalized nature of international trade and the urgency of climate change, decarbonizing the
industrial sector must become a key priority for both policy makers and factory owners worldwide. As we
have seen, there are a number of highly impactful applications where ML can help reduce GHG emissions
in industry, with several caveats. First, incentives for cleaner production and distribution are not always
aligned with reduced costs, though policies can play a role in aligning these incentives. Second, despite the
proliferation of industrial data, much of the information is proprietary, low-quality, or very speciﬁc to indi-
vidual machines or processes; practitioners estimate that 60-70% of industrial data goes unused [359, 400].
Before investing in extensive ML research, researchers should be sure that they will be able to eventually
access and clean any data needed for their algorithms. Finally, misjudgments can be very costly for man-
ufacturers and retailers, leading most managers to adopt risk-averse strategies towards relatively untested
technologies such as ML [391]. For this reason, ML algorithms that determine industrial activities should
be robust enough to guarantee both performance and safety, along with providing both interpretable and
reproducible results [401].

5 Farms & Forests

by Alexandre Lacoste

Plants, microbes, and other organisms have been drawing CO2 from the atmosphere for millions of years.
Most of this carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through the carbon cycle, and some is stored
deep underground as coal and oil, but a large amount of carbon is sequestered in the biomass of trees, peat
bogs, and soil. Our current economy encourages practices that are freeing much of this sequestered carbon
through deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. On top of these effects, cattle and rice farming generate
methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than CO2 itself. Overall, land use by humans is estimated to be
responsible for about a quarter of global GHG emissions [26] (and this may be an underestimate [402]). In
addition to this direct release of carbon through human actions, the permafrost is now melting, peat bogs are
drying, and forest ﬁres are becoming more frequent as a consequence of climate change itself – all of which
release yet more carbon [403].

The large scale of this problem allows for a similar scale of positive impact. According to one estimate
[404], about a third of GHG emissions reductions could come from better land management and agriculture.
ML can play an important role in some of these areas. Precision agriculture could reduce carbon release
from the soil and improve crop yield, which in turn could reduce the need for deforestation. Satellite
images make it possible to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered in a given area of land, as well as
track GHG emissions from it. ML can help monitor the health of forests and peatlands, predict the risk of
ﬁre, and contribute to sustainable forestry (Fig. 5). These areas represent highly impactful applications, in
particular, of sophisticated computer vision tools, though care must be taken in some cases to avoid negative
consequences via the Jevons paradox.

Figure 5: Selected strategies to mitigate GHG emissions from land use using machine learning.

5.1 Remote sensing of emissions

High Leverage

Having real-time maps of GHGs could help us quantify emissions from agriculture and forestry practices,
as well as monitor emissions from other sectors (§1.2).

Such information would be valuable in guiding regulations or incentives that could lead to better land
use practices. For example, data on emissions make it possible to set effective targets, and pinpointing the
sources of emissions makes it possible to enforce regulations.

While greenhouse gases are invisible to our eyes, they must by deﬁnition interact with sunlight. This
means that we can observe these compounds with hyperspectral cameras [405, 406]. These cameras can
record up to several hundred wavelengths (instead of simply RGB), providing information on the interaction
between light and individual chemicals. Many satellites are equipped with such cameras and can perform,

30

to some extent, estimations of CO2, CH4 (methane), H2O, and N2O (nitrous oxide) emissions [407, 408].
While extremely useful for studying climate change, most of these satellites have very coarse spatial resolu-
tion and large temporal and spatial gaps, making them unsuitable for precise tracking of emissions. Standard
satellite imagery provides RGB images with much higher resolution, which could be used in an ML algo-
rithm to ﬁll the gaps in hyperspectral data and obtain more precise information about emissions.23 Some
preliminary work [407] has studied this possibility, but there are no clear results as of yet. This is therefore
an open problem with high potential impact.

5.2 Precision agriculture

High Leverage Uncertain Impact

Agriculture is responsible for about 14% of GHG emissions [26]. This might come as a surprise, since plants
take up CO2 from the air. However, modern industrial agriculture involves more than just growing plants.
First, the land is stripped of trees, releasing carbon sequestered there. Second, the process of tilling exposes
topsoil to the air, thereby releasing carbon that had been bound in soil aggregates and disrupting organisms
in the soil that contribute to sequestration. Finally, because such farming practices strip soil of nutrients,
nitrogen-based fertilizers must be added back to the system. Synthesizing these fertilizers consumes massive
amounts of energy, about 2% of global energy consumption [386] (see §4.2). Moreover, while some of this
nitrogen is absorbed by plants or retained in the soil, some is converted to nitrous oxide,24 a greenhouse gas
that is about 300 times more potent than CO2.

Such industrial agriculture approaches are ultimately based on making farmland more uniform and pre-
dictable. This allows it to be managed at scale using basic automation tools like tractors, but can be both
more destructive and less productive than approaches that work with the natural heterogeneity of land and
crops. Increasingly, there is demand for sophisticated tools which would allow farmers to work at scale, but
adapt to what the land needs. This approach is often known as “precision agriculture.”

Smarter robotic tools can help enable precision agriculture. RIPPA [410], a robot under development at
the University of Sydney, is equipped with a hyperspectral camera and has the capacity to perform mechan-
ical weeding, targeted pesticide application, and vacuuming of pests. It can cover 5 acres per day on solar
energy and collect large datasets [411] for continual improvement. Many other robotic platforms25 likewise
offer opportunities for developing new ML algorithms. There remains signiﬁcant room for development in
this space, since current robots still sometimes get stuck, are optimized only for certain types of crops, and
rely on ML algorithms that may be highly sensitive to changes of environment.

There are many additional ways in which ML can contribute to precision agriculture. Intelligent irri-
gation systems can save large amounts of water while reducing pests that thrive under excessive moisture
[404]. ML can also help in disease detection, weed detection, and soil sensing [412–414]. ML can guide
crop yield prediction [415] and even macroeconomic models that help farmers predict crop demand and
decide what to plant at the beginning of the season [416]. These problems often have minimal hardware re-
quirements, as devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with hyperspectral cameras can be used
for all of these tasks.

Globally, agriculture constitutes a $2.4 trillion industry [417], and there is already a signiﬁcant economic
incentive to increase efﬁciency. However, efﬁciency gains do not necessarily translate into reduced GHG
emissions (e.g. via the Jevons paradox). Moreover, signiﬁcantly reducing emissions may require a shift in
agricultural paradigms – for example, widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture, silvopasture, and tree

23Microsatellites with higher resolution hyperspectral cameras are expected to launch over the coming years, including a proposal
by Blueﬁeld Technologies that would provide methane detection at 20-meter spatial resolution with daily refresh. Even once this
technology comes online, ML will remain useful to cover the daily gaps and to estimate emissions of other GHGs.

24Some fertilizer additionally often ends up in waterways, which can contaminate drinking water and induce blooms of toxic

algae [409].

intercropping [404]. ML tools for policy makers and agronomists [418] could potentially encourage climate-
positive action: for example, remote sensing with UAVs and satellites could perform methane detection and
carbon stock estimation, which could be used to incentivize farmers to sequester more carbon and reduce
emissions.

5.3 Monitoring peatlands

High Leverage

Peatlands (a type of wetland ecosystem) cover only 3% of the Earth’s land area, yet hold twice the total
carbon in all the world’s forests, making peat the largest source of sequestered carbon on Earth [419].
When peat dries, however, it releases carbon through decomposition and also becomes susceptible to ﬁre
[419, 420]. A single peat ﬁre in Indonesia in 1997 is reported to have released emissions comparable to
20-50% of global fossil fuel emissions during the same year [421].

Monitoring peatlands and protecting them from artiﬁcial drainage or droughts is essential to preserve
the carbon sequestered in them [422, 423]. In [424], ML was applied to features extracted from remote
sensing data to estimate the thickness of peat and assess the carbon stock of tropical peatlands. A more
precise peatlands map is expected to be made by 2020 using specialized satellites [425]. Advanced ML
could potentially help develop precise monitoring tools at low cost and predict the risk of ﬁre.

5.4 Managing forests

Estimating carbon stock
High Leverage
Modeling (and pricing) carbon stored in forests requires us to assess how much is being sequestered or
released across the planet. Since most of a forest’s carbon is stored in above-ground biomass [426], tree
species and heights are a good indicator of the carbon stock.

The height of trees can be estimated fairly accurately with LiDAR devices mounted on UAVs, but this
technology is not scalable and many areas are closed to UAVs. To address this challenge, ML can be used
to predict the LiDAR’s outcome from satellite imagery [426, 427]. From there, the learned estimator can
perform predictions at the scale of the planet. Despite progress in this area, there is still signiﬁcant room for
improvement. For example, LiDAR data is often not equally distributed across regions or seasons. Hence
domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques may help algorithms to generalize better.

Automating afforestation
Long-term Uncertain Impact
Planting trees, also called afforestation, can be a means of sequestering CO2 over the long term. According
to one estimate, up to 0.9 billion hectares of extra canopy cover could theoretically be added [428] globally.
However, care must be taken when planting trees to ensure a positive impact. Afforestation that comes at
the expense of farmland (or ecosystems such as peat bogs) could result in a net increase of GHG emissions.
Moreover, planting trees without regard for local conditions and native species can reduce the climate impact
of afforestation as well as negatively affecting biodiversity.

ML can be helpful in automating large-scale afforestation by locating appropriate planting sites, mon-
itoring plant health, assessing weeds, and analyzing trends. Startups like BioCarbon Engineering26 and
Droneseed27 are even developing UAVs that are capable of planting seed packets more quickly and cheaply
than traditional methods [429].

Managing forest ﬁres
Besides their potential for harming people and property, forest ﬁres release CO2 into the atmosphere (which

26www.biocarbonengineering.com
27www.droneseed.co

32

in turn increases the rate of forest ﬁres [430]). On the other hand, small forest ﬁres are part of natural
forest cycles. Preventing them causes biomass to accumulate on the ground and increases the chances of
large ﬁres, which can then burn all trees to the ground and erode top soil, resulting in high CO2 emissions,
biodiversity loss, and a long recovery time [431]. Drought forecasting [432] is helpful in predicting regions
that are more at risk, as is estimating the water content in the tree canopy [433]. In [434, 435], reinforcement
learning is used to predict the spatial progression of ﬁre. This helps ﬁreﬁghters decide when to let a ﬁre burn
and when to stop it [436]. With good tools to evaluate regions that are more at risk, ﬁreﬁghters can perform
controlled burns and cut select areas to prevent the progression of ﬁres.

Reducing deforestation
High Leverage
Only 17% of the world’s forests are legally protected [437]. The rest are subject to deforestation, which
contributes to approximately 10% of global GHG emissions [26] as vegetation is burned or decays. While
some deforestation is the result of expanding agriculture or urban developments, most of it comes from the
logging industry. Clearcutting, which has a particularly ruinous effect upon ecosystems and the carbon they
sequester, remains a widespread practice across the world.

Tools for tracking deforestation can provide valuable data for informing policy makers, as well as law
enforcement in cases where deforestation may be conducted illegally. ML can be used to differentiate
selective cutting from clearcutting using remote sensing imagery [438–441]. Another approach is to install
(old) smartphones powered by solar panels in the forest; ML can then be used to detect and report chainsaw
sounds within a one-kilometer radius [442].

Logistics and transport still dominate the cost of wood harvesting, which often motivates clearcutting.
Increasingly, ML tools [443] are becoming available to help foresters decide when to harvest, where to
fertilize, and what roads to build. However, once more, the Jevons paradox is at play; making forestry
more efﬁcient can have a negative effect by increasing the amount of wood harvested. On the other hand,
developing the right combination of tools for regulation and selective cutting could have a signiﬁcant positive
impact.

5.5 Discussion

Farms and forests make up a large portion of global GHG emissions, but reducing these emissions is chal-
lenging. The scope of the problem is highly globalized, but the necessary actions are highly localized. Many
applications also involve a diversity of stakeholders. Agriculture, for example, involves a complex mix of
large-scale farming interests, small-scale farmers, agricultural equipment manufacturers, and chemical com-
panies. Each stakeholder has different interests, and each often has access to a different portion of the data
that would be useful for impactful ML applications. Interfacing between these different stakeholders is a
practical challenge for meaningful work in this area.

6 Carbon Dioxide Removal

by Andrew S. Ross and Evan D. Sherwin

Even if we could cut emissions to zero today, we would still face signiﬁcant climate consequences from
greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere. Eliminating emissions entirely may also be tricky, given the
sheer diversity of sources (such as airplanes and cows). Instead, many experts argue that to meet critical
climate goals, global emissions must become net-negative—that is, we must remove more CO2 from the
atmosphere than we release [444, 445]. Although there has been signiﬁcant progress in negative emis-
sions research [446–450], the actual CO2 removal industry is still in its infancy. As such, many of the
ML applications we outline in this section are either speculative or in the early stages of development or
commercialization.

Many of the primary candidate technologies for CO2 removal directly harness the same natural pro-
cesses which have (pre-)historically shaped our atmosphere. One of the most promising methods is simply
allowing or encouraging more natural uptake of CO2 by plants (whose ML applications we discuss in §5).
Other plant-based methods include bioenergy with carbon capture and biochar, where plants are grown
speciﬁcally to absorb CO2 and then burned in a way that sequesters it (while creating energy or fertilizer as
a useful byproduct) [446, 451, 452]. Finally, the way most of Earth’s CO2 has been removed over geologic
timescales is the slow process of mineral weathering, which also initiates further CO2 absorption in the
ocean due to alkaline runoff [453]. These processes can both be massively accelerated by human activity
to achieve necessary scales of CO2 removal [446]. However, although these biomass, mineral, and ocean-
based methods are all promising enough as techniques to merit mention, they may have drawbacks in terms
of land use and potentially serious environmental impacts, and (more relevantly for this paper) they would
not likely beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from ML.

6.1 Direct air capture

Long-term

Another approach is to build facilities to extract CO2 from power plant exhaust, industrial processes, or
even ambient air [454]. While this “direct air capture” (DAC) approach faces technical hurdles, it requires
little land and has, according to current understanding, minimal negative environmental impacts [455]. The
basic idea behind DAC is to blow air onto CO2 sorbents (essentially like sponges, but for gas), which are
either solid or in solution, then use heat-powered chemical processes to release the CO2 in puriﬁed form for
sequestration [446, 447]. Several companies have recently been started to pilot these methods.28, 29, 30

While CO2 sorbents are improving signiﬁcantly [456, 457], issues still remain with efﬁciency and degra-
dation over time, offering potential (though still speculative) opportunities for ML. ML could be used (as
in §1.1.1) to accelerate materials discovery and process engineering workﬂows [87, 92, 93, 458] to maxi-
mize sorbent reusability and CO2 uptake while minimizing the energy required for CO2 release. ML might
also help to develop corrosion-resistant components capable of withstanding high temperatures, as well as
optimize their geometry for air-sorbent contact (which strongly impacts efﬁciency [459]).

6.2 Sequestering CO2

High Leverage Long-term Uncertain Impact

Once CO2 is captured, it must be sequestered or stored, securely and at scale, to prevent re-release back into
the atmosphere. The best-understood form of CO2 sequestration is direct injection into geologic formations
such as saline aquifers, which are generally similar to oil and gas reservoirs [446]. A Norwegian oil company
has successfully sequestered CO2 from an offshore natural gas ﬁeld in a saline aquifer for more than twenty

30https://globalthermostat.com/

34

years [460]. Another promising option is to sequester CO2 in volcanic basalt formations, which is being
piloted in Iceland [461].

Machine learning may be able to help with many aspects of CO2 sequestration. First, ML can help
identify and characterize potential storage locations. Oil and gas companies have had promising results us-
ing ML for subsurface imaging based on raw seismograph traces [462]. These models and the data behind
them could likely be repurposed to help trap CO2 rather than release it. Second, ML can help monitor and
maintain active sequestration sites. Noisy sensor measurements must be translated into inferences about
subsurface CO2 ﬂow and remaining injection capacity [463]; recently, [464] found success using convo-
lutional image-to-image regression techniques for uncertainty quantiﬁcation in a global CO2 storage sim-
ulation study. Additionally, it is important to monitor for CO2 leaks [465]. ML techniques have recently
been applied to monitoring potential CO2 leaks from wells [466]; computer vision approaches for emissions
detection (see [467] and §5.1) may also be applicable.

6.3 Discussion

Given limits on how much more CO2 humanity can safely emit and the difﬁculties associated with elimi-
nating emissions entirely, CO2 removal may have a critical role to play in tackling climate change. Promis-
ing applications for ML in CO2 removal include informing research and development of novel component
materials, characterizing geologic resource availability, and monitoring underground CO2 in sequestration
facilities. Although many of these applications are speculative, the industry is growing, which will create
more data and more opportunities for ML approaches to help.

Adaptation

7 Climate Prediction

by Kelly Kochanski

The ﬁrst global warming prediction was made in 1896, when Arrhenius estimated that burning fossil fu-
els could eventually release enough CO2 to warm the Earth by 5◦C. The fundamental physics underlying
those calculations has not changed, but our predictions have become far more detailed and precise. The
predominant predictive tools are climate models, known as General Circulation Models (GCMs) or Earth
System Models (ESMs).31 These models inform local and national government decisions (see IPCC reports
[4, 26, 469]), help people calculate their climate risks (see §10 and §8) and allow us to estimate the potential
impacts of solar geoengineering (see §9).

Recent trends have created opportunities for ML to advance the state-of-the-art in climate prediction
(Fig. 6). First, new and cheaper satellites are creating petabytes of climate observation data.32 Second, mas-
sive climate modeling projects are generating petabytes of simulated climate data.33 Third, climate forecasts
are computationally expensive [473] (the simulations in [472] took three weeks to run on NCAR supercom-
puters), while ML methods are becoming increasingly fast to train and run, especially on next-generation
computing hardware. As a result, climate scientists have recently begun to explore ML techniques, and are
starting to team up with computer scientists to build new and exciting applications.

7.1 Uniting data, ML, and climate science

Climate models represent our understanding of Earth and climate physics. We can learn about the Earth by
collecting data. To turn that data into useful predictions, we need to condense it into coherent, computation-
ally tractable models. ML models are likely to be more accurate or less expensive than other models where:
(1) there is plentiful data, but it is hard to model systems with traditional statistics, or (2) there are good
models, but they are too computationally expensive to use in production.

7.1.1 Data for climate models

When data are plentiful, climate scientists build data-driven models. In these areas, ML techniques may
solve many problems that were previously challenging. These include black box problems, for instance
sensor calibration [474], and classiﬁcation of observational data, for instance classifying crop cover or iden-
tifying pollutant sources in satellite imagery [475, 476]. More applications like these are likely to appear
as satellite databases grow. The authors of [13] describe many opportunities for data scientists to assimilate
data from diverse ﬁeld and remote sensing sources, many of which have since been explored by climate
informatics researchers.

Numerous authors, such as [477], have identiﬁed geoscience problems that would be aided by the de-
velopment of benchmark datasets. Efforts to develop such datasets include EnviroNet [478], the IS-GEO
benchmark datasets [479], and ExtremeWeather [480]. We expect the collection of curated geoscience
datasets to continue to grow; this process might even be accelerated by ML optimizations in data collection
systems [477]. We strongly encourage modellers to dive into the data in collaboration with domain experts.
We also recommend that modellers who seek to learn directly from data see [481] for speciﬁc advice on
ﬁtting and over-ﬁtting climate data.

7.1.2 Accelerating climate models

Many climate prediction problems are irremediably data-limited. No matter how many weather stations we
construct, how many ﬁeld campaigns we run, or how many satellites we deploy, the Earth will generate at
most one year of new climate data per year. Existing climate models deal with this limitation by relying
heavily on physical laws, such as thermodynamics. These models are structured in terms of coupled partial
differential equations that represent physical processes like cloud formation, ice sheet ﬂow, and permafrost
melt. ML models provide new techniques for solving such systems efﬁciently.

Clouds and aerosols
High Leverage
Recent work has shown how deep neural networks could be combined with existing thermodynamics knowl-
edge to ﬁx the largest source of uncertainty in current climate models: clouds. Bright clouds block sunlight
and cool the Earth; dark clouds catch outgoing heat and keep the Earth warm [469, 482]. These effects are
controlled by small-scale processes such as cloud convection and atmospheric aerosols (see uses of aerosols
for cloud seeding and solar geoengineering in §9). Physical models of these processes are far too compu-
tationally expensive to include in global climate models — but ML models are not. Gentine et al. trained
a deep neural network to emulate the behavior of a high-resolution cloud simulation, and found that the
network gave similar results for a fraction of the cost [483] and was stable in a simpliﬁed global model
[484]. Existing scientiﬁc model structures do not always offer great trade-offs between cost and accuracy.
Neural networks trained on those scientiﬁc models produce similar predictions, but offer an entirely new
set of compromises between training cost, production cost, and accuracy. Replacing select climate model
components with neural network approximators may thus improve both the cost and the accuracy of global

37

climate models. Additional work is needed to identify more climate model components that could be re-
placed by neural networks (we highlight other impactful components below), to optimize those models, and
to automate their training workﬂows (see examples in [485]).

Ice sheets and sea level rise
High Leverage
The next most important targets for climate model improvements are ice sheet dynamics and sea level rise.
The Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than anywhere else on Earth, and their climates control the
future of global sea level rise and many vulnerable ecosystems [4, 26]. Unfortunately, these regions are
dark and cold, and until recently they were difﬁcult to observe. In the past few years, however, new satellite
campaigns have illuminated them with hundreds of terabytes of data.34 These data could make it possible to
use ML to solve some of the ﬁeld’s biggest outstanding questions. In particular, models of mass loss from
the Antarctic ice-sheet are highly uncertain [486] and models of the extent of Antarctic sea ice do not match
reality well [487]. The most uncertain parts of these models, and thus the best targets for improvement,
are snow reﬂectivity, sea ice reﬂectivity, ocean heat mixing and ice sheet grounding line migration rates
[481, 486, 488]. Computer scientists who wish to work in this area could build models that learn snow and
sea ice properties from satellite data, or use new video prediction techniques to predict short-term changes
in the sea ice extent.

7.1.3 Working with climate models

ML could also be used to identify and leverage relationships between climate variables. Pattern recognition
and feature extraction techniques could allow us to identify more useful connections in the climate system,
and regression models could allow us to quantify non-linear relationships between connected variables.
For example, Nowack et al. demonstrated that ozone concentrations could be computed as a function of
temperature, rather than physical transport laws, which led to considerable computational savings [489].

The best climate predictions are synthesized from ensembles of 20+ climate models [490]. Making good
ensemble predictions is an excellent ML problem. Monteleoni et al. proposed that online ML algorithms
could create better predictions of one or more target variables in a multi-model ensemble of climate models
[491]; this idea has been reﬁned in [492, 493]. More recently, Anderson and Lucas used random forests to
make high-resolution predictions from a mix of high- and low-resolution models, which could reduce the
costs of building multi-model ensembles [494].

In the further future, the Climate Modeling Alliance has proposed to build an entirely new climate model
that learns continuously from data and from high-resolution simulations [495]. The proposed model would
be written in Julia, in contrast to existing models which are mostly written in C++ and Fortran. At the cost
of a daunting translation workload, they aim to build a model that is more accessible to new developers and
more compatible with ML libraries.

7.2 Forecasting extreme events

For most people, extreme event prediction means the local weather forecast and a few days’ warning to
stockpile food, go home, and lock the shutters. Weather forecasts are shorter-term than climate forecasts,
but they produce abundant data. Weather models are optimized to track the rapid, chaotic changes of the
atmosphere; since these changes are fast, tomorrow’s weather forecast is made and tested every day. Climate
models, in contrast, are chaotic on short time scales, but their long-term trends are driven by slow, predictable
changes of ocean, land, and ice (see [496]).35 As a result, climate model output can only be tested against
long-term observations (at the scale of years to decades). Intermediate time scales, of weeks to months, are

34See e.g. icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov and pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem.
35This is one of several reasons why climate models produce accurate long-term predictions in spite of atmospheric chaos.

38

exceptionally difﬁcult to predict, although Cohen et al. [497] argue that machine learning could bridge that
gap by making good predictions on four to six week timescales [498]. Thus far, however, weather modelers
have had hundreds of times more test data than climate modelers, and began to adopt ML techniques earlier.
Numerous ML weather models are already running in production. For example, Gagne et al. recently used
an ensemble of random forests to improve hail predictions within a major weather model [499].

A full review of the applications of ML for extreme weather forecasting is beyond the scope of this
article. Fortunately, that review has already been written: see [500]. The authors describe ML systems that
correct bias, recognize patterns, and predict storms. Moving forward, they envision human experts working
alongside automated forecasts.

7.2.1 Storm tracking

Climate models cannot predict the speciﬁc dates of future events, but they can predict changes in long-term
trends like drought frequency and storm intensity. Information about these trends helps individuals, corpo-
rations and towns make informed decisions about infrastructure, asset valuation and disaster response plans
(see also §8.4). Identifying extreme events in climate model output, however, is a classiﬁcation problem with
a twist: all of the available data sets are strongly skewed because extreme events are, by deﬁnition, rare. ML
has been used successfully to classify some extreme weather events. Researchers have used deep learning to
classify [501], detect [480] and segment [502] cyclones and atmospheric rivers, as well as tornadoes [503],
in historical climate datasets. Tools for more event types would be useful, as would online tools that work
within climate models, labelled datasets for predicting future events, and statistical tools that quantify the
uncertainty in new extreme event forecasts.

7.2.2 Local forecasts

High Leverage

Forecasts are most actionable if they are speciﬁc and local. ML is widely used to make local forecasts
from coarse 10–100 km climate or weather model predictions; various authors have attempted this using
support vector machines, autoencoders, Bayesian deep learning, and super-resolution convolutional neural
networks (e.g. [504]). Several groups are now working to translate high-resolution climate forecasts into
risk scenarios. For example, ML can predict localized ﬂooding patterns from past data [505], which could
inform individuals buying insurance or homes. Since ML methods like neural networks are effective at
predicting local ﬂooding during extreme weather events [506], these could be used to update local ﬂood risk
estimates to beneﬁt individuals. The start-up Jupiter Intelligence is working to make climate predictions
more actionable by translating climate forecasts into localised ﬂood and temperature risk scores.

7.3 Discussion

ML may change the way that scientiﬁc modeling is done. The examples above have shown that many com-
ponents of large climate models can be replaced with ML models at lower computational costs. From an
ML standpoint, learning from an existing model has many advantages: modelers can generate new training
and test data on-demand, and the new ML model inherits some community trust from the old one. This
is an area of active ML research. Recent papers have explored data-efﬁcient techniques for learning dy-
namical systems [507], including physics-informed neural networks [508] and neural ordinary differential
equations [151]. In the further future, researchers are developing ML approaches for a wide range of scien-
tiﬁc modeling challenges, including crash prediction [509], adaptive numerical meshing [510], uncertainty
quantiﬁcation [511, 512] and performance optimization [513]. If these strategies are effective, they may
solve some of the largest structural challenges facing current climate models.

New ML models for climate will be most successful if they are closely integrated into existing scientiﬁc
models. This has been emphasized, again and again, by authors who have laid future paths for artiﬁcial

39

intelligence within climate science [477, 484, 485, 495, 500, 514]. New models need to leverage existing
knowledge to make good predictions with limited data. In ten years, we will have more satellite data, more
interpretable ML techniques, hopefully more trust from the scientiﬁc community, and possibly a new climate
model written in Julia. For now, however, ML models must be creatively designed to work within existing
climate models. The best of these models are likely to be built by close-knit teams including both climate
and computational scientists.

8 Societal Impacts

by Kris Sankaran

Changes in the atmosphere have impacts on the ground. The expected societal impacts of climate change
include prolonged ecological and socioeconomic stresses as well as brief, but severe, societal disruptions.
For example, impacts could include both gradual decreases in crop yield and localized food shortages. If we
can anticipate climate impacts well enough, then we can prepare for them by asking:

• How do we reduce vulnerability to climate impacts?

• How do we support rapid recovery from climate-induced disruptions?

A wide variety of strategies have been put forward, from robust power grids to food shortage prediction
(Fig. 7), and while this is good news for society, it can be overwhelming for an ML practitioner hoping to
contribute. Fortunately, a few critical needs tend to recur across strategies – it is by meeting these needs that
ML has the greatest potential to support societal adaptation [8, 16, 515]. From a high level, these involve

• Sounding alarms: Identifying and prioritizing the areas of highest risk, by using evidence of risk from

historical data.

• Providing annotation: Extracting actionable information or labels from unstructured raw data.

• Promoting exchange: Making it easier to share resources and information to pool and reduce risk.

These unifying threads will appear repeatedly in the sections below, where we review strategies to help
ecosystems, infrastructure, and societies adapt to climate change, and explain how ML supports each strat-
egy (Fig. 7).

Figure 7: Selected strategies to accelerate societal adaptation to climate change using machine learning.

41

We note that the projects involved vary in scale from local to global, from infrastructure upgrades and
crisis preparedness planning to international ecosystem monitoring and disease surveillance. Hence, we an-
ticipate valuable contributions by researchers who have the ﬂexibility to formulate experimental approaches,
by industrial engineers and entrepreneurs who have the expertise to translate prototypes into wide-reaching
systems, and by civil servants who lead many existing climate adaptation efforts.

8.1 Ecology

Changes in climate are increasingly affecting the distribution and composition of ecosystems. This has
profound implications for global biodiversity, as well as agriculture, disease, and natural resources such as
wood and ﬁsh. ML can help by supporting efforts to monitor ecosystems and biodiversity.

Monitoring ecosystems
High Leverage
To preserve ecosystems, it is important to know which are most at risk. This has traditionally been done via
manual, on-the-ground observation, but the process can be accelerated by annotation of remote sensing data
[516–519] (see also §5.1). For example, tree cover can be automatically extracted from aerial imagery to
characterize deforestation [520, 521]. At the scale of regions or biomes, analysis of large-scale simulations
can illuminate the evolution of ecosystems across potential climate futures [522, 523]. A more direct source
of data is offered by environmental sensor networks, made from densely packed but low-cost devices [12,
524, 525]. To monitor ocean ecosystems, marine robots are useful, because they can be used to survey large
areas on demand [526, 527].

For a system to have the most real-world impact, regardless of the underlying data source, it is necessary
to “personalize” predictions across a range of ecosystems. A model trained on the Sahara would almost
certainly fail if deployed in the Amazon. Hence, these applications may motivate ML researchers interested
in heterogeneity, data collection, transfer learning, and rapid generalization. In sensor networks, individual
nodes fail frequently, but are redundant by design – this is an opportunity for research into anomaly detection
and missing data imputation [528, 529]. In marine robotics, improved techniques for sampling regions to
explore and automatic summarization of expedition results would both provide value [530, 531]. Finally,
beyond aiding adaptation by prioritizing at-risk environments, the design of effective methods for ecosystem
monitoring will support the basic science necessary to shape adaptation in the long-run [11, 14, 532].

Monitoring biodiversity
High Leverage
Accurate estimates of species populations are the foundation on which conservation efforts are built. Cam-
era traps and aerial imagery have increased the richness and coverage of sampling efforts. ML can help
infer biodiversity counts from image-based sensors. For instance, camera traps take photos automatically
whenever a motion sensor is activated – computer vision can be used to classify the species that pass by,
supporting a real-time, less labor-intensive species count [533–535]. It is also possible to use aerial imagery
to estimate the size of large herds [536] or count birds [537]. In underwater ecosystems, ML has been used
to identify plankton automatically from underwater cameras [538] and to infer ﬁsh populations from the
structure of coral reefs [539].

Citizen science can also enable dataset collection at a scale impossible in individual studies [540–543].
For example, by leveraging public enthusiasm for birdwatching, eBird has logged more than 140 million
observations [540], which have been used for population and migration studies [544]. Computer vision al-
gorithms that can classify species from photographs have furthered such citizen science efforts by making
identiﬁcations easier and more accurate [545, 546], though these face challenges such as class imbalances
in training data [547]. Work with citizen science data poses the additional challenge that researchers have
no control over where samples come from. To incentivize observations from undersampled regions, mech-

42

anisms from game theory can be applied [548], and even when sampling biases persist, estimates of dataset
shift can minimize their inﬂuence [549].

Monitoring biodiversity may be paired with interventions to protect rare species or control invasive pests.
Machine learning is providing new solutions to assess the impact of ecological interventions [550–552] and
prevent poaching [548].

8.2

Infrastructure

Physical infrastructure is so tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life – like the buildings we inhabit and
lights we switch on – that it is easy to forget that it exists (see §3). The fact that something so basic will
have to be rethought in order to adapt to climate change can be unsettling, but viewed differently, the sheer
necessity of radical redesign can inspire creative thinking.

We ﬁrst consider the impacts of climate change on the built environment. Shifts in weather patterns
are likely to put infrastructure under more persistent stress. Heat and wind damage roads, buildings, and
power lines. Rising water tables near the coast will lead to faults in pipelines. Urban heat islands will be
exacerbated and it is likely that there will be an increased risk of ﬂooding caused by heavy rain or coastal
inundations, resulting in property damage and trafﬁc blockages[553].

A clear target is construction of physical defenses – for example, “climate prooﬁng” cities with new
coastal embankments and increased storm drainage capacity. However, focusing solely on defending ex-
isting structures can stiﬂe proactive thinking about urban and social development – for example, ﬂoating
buildings are being tested in Rotterdam – and one may alternatively consider resilience and recovery more
broadly [554, 555]. From this more general perspective of improving social processes, ML can support two
types of activities: Design and maintenance.

Designing infrastructure
Long-term
How can infrastructure be (re)designed to dampen climate impacts? In road networks, it is possible to
incorporate ﬂood hazard and trafﬁc information in order to uncover vulnerable stretches of road, especially
those with few alternative routes [556]. If trafﬁc data are not directly available, it is possible to construct
proxies from mobile phone usage and city-wide CCTV streams – these are promising in rapidly developing
urban centers [557, 558]. Beyond drawing from ﬂood hazard maps, it is possible to use data from real-world
ﬂooding events [559], and to send localized predictions to those at risk [560]. For electrical, water, and waste
collection networks, the same principle can guide investments in resilience – using proxy or historical data
about disruptions to anticipate vulnerabilities [561–564]. Robust components can replace those at risk; for
example, adaptive islands, parts of an energy grid that continue to provide power even when disconnected
from the network, prevent cascading outages in power distribution [565].

Infrastructure is long-lived, but the future is uncertain, and planners must weigh immediate resource
costs against future societal risks [566]. One area that urgently needs adaptation strategies is the consistent
access to drinking water, which can be jeopardized by climate variability [567, 568]. Investments in water
infrastructure can be optimized; for example, a larger dam might cost more up front, but would have a larger
storage capacity, giving a stronger buffer against drought. To delay immediate decisions, infrastructure can
be upgraded in phases – the technical challenge is to discover policies that minimize a combination of long-
term resource and societal costs under plausible climate futures, with forecasts being updated as climates
evolve [569–571].

Maintaining infrastructure
High Leverage
What types of systems can keep infrastructure functioning well under increased stress? Two strategies for
efﬁciently managing limited maintenance resources are predictive maintenance and anomaly detection; both
can be applied to electrical, water, and transportation infrastructure. In predictive maintenance, operations

43

are prioritized according to the predicted probability of a near-term breakdown [137, 138, 572, 573]. For
anomaly detection, failures are discovered as soon as they occur, without having to wait for inspectors to
show up, or complaints to stream in [574, 575].

The systems referenced here have required the manual curation of data streams, structured and unstruc-
tured. The data are plentiful, just difﬁcult to glue together. Ideas from the missing data, multimodal data,
and AutoML communities have the potential to resolve some of these issues.

8.3 Social systems

While less tangible, the social systems we construct are just as critical to the smooth functioning of society as
any physical infrastructure, and it is important that they adapt to changing climate conditions. First, consider
what changes these systems may encounter. Decreases in crop yield, due to drought and other factors, will
pose a threat to food security, as already evidenced by long periods of drought in North America, West Africa
and East Asia [576, 577]. More generally, communities dependent on ecosystem resources will ﬁnd their
livelihoods at risk, and this may result in mass migrations, as people seek out more supportive environments.
At ﬁrst, these problems may seem beyond the reach of algorithmic thinking, but investments in social
infrastructure can increase resilience. ML can amplify the reach and effectiveness of this infrastructure. See
also §11 for perspective on how ML can support the function and analysis of complex social environments.

Food security
High Leverage
Data can be used to monitor the risk of food insecurity in real time, to forecast near-term shortages, and
to identify areas at risk in the long-term, all of which can guide interventions. For real-time and near-term
systems, it is possible to distill relevant signals from mobile phones, credit card transactions, and social
media data [578–580]. These have emerged as low-cost, high-reach alternatives to manual surveying. The
idea is to train models that link these large, but decontextualized, data with ground truth consumption or
survey information, collected on small representative samples. This process of developing proxies to link
small, rich datasets with large, coarse ones can be viewed as a type of semi-supervised learning, and is fertile
ground for research.

For longer-term warnings, spatially localized crop yield predictions are needed. These can be generated
by aerial imagery or meteorological data (see §5.2), if they can be linked with historical yield data [581,
582]. On the ground, it is possible to perform crop-disease identiﬁcation from plant photos – this can alert
communities to disease outbreaks, and enhance the capacity of agricultural inspectors. For even longer-
run risk evaluation, it is possible to simulate crop yield via biological and ecological models [583–585],
presenting another opportunity for blending large scale simulation with ML [586, 587].

Beyond sounding alarms, ML can improve resilience of food supply chains. As detailed in §4, ML can
reduce waste along these chains; we emphasize that for adaptation, it is important that supply chains also be
made robust to unexpected disruptions [588–591].

Resilient livelihoods
Individuals whose livelihoods depend on one activity, and who have less access to community resources,
are those who are most at risk [592, 593]. Resilient livelihoods can be promoted through increased diver-
siﬁcation, cooperation, and exchange, all of which can be facilitated by ML systems. For example, they
can guide equipment and information sharing in farming cooperatives, via growers’ social networks [594].
Mobile money efforts can increase access to liquid purchasing power; they can also be used to monitor eco-
nomic health [595, 596]. Skill-matching programs and online training are often driven by data, with some
programs speciﬁcally aiming to beneﬁt refugees [597–599] (see also §12).

44

Supporting displaced people
Long-term Uncertain Impact
Human populations move in response to threats and opportunities, and ML can be used to predict large-
scale migration patterns. Work in this area has relied on accessible proxies, like social media, where users’
often self-report location information, or aerial imagery, from which the extent of informal settlement can
be gauged [600–603]. More than quantifying migration patterns, there have been efforts directly aimed
at protecting refugees, either through improving rescue operations [604, 605] or monitoring negative public
sentiment [606]. It is worth cautioning that immigrants and refugees are vulnerable groups, and systems that
surveil them can easily be exploited by bad actors. Designing methodology and governance mechanisms
that allow vulnerable populations to beneﬁt from such data, without putting them at additional risk, should
be a research priority.

Assessing health risks
Climate change will affect exposure to health hazards, and machine learning can play a role in measuring
and mitigating their impacts across subpopulations. Two of the most relevant expected shifts are (1) heat
waves will become more frequent and (2) outdoor and indoor air quality will deteriorate [607, 608]. These
exposures have either direct or indirect effects on health. For example, prolonged heat episodes both directly
cause heat stroke and can trigger acute episodes in chronic conditions, like heart or respiratory disease
[609, 610].

Careful data collection and analysis have played a leading role in epidemiology and public health efforts
for generations. It should be no surprise that ML has emerged as an important tool in these disciplines,
supporting a variety of research efforts, from increasing the efﬁciency of disease simulators to supporting
the ﬁne-grained measurement of exposures and their health impacts [611, 612].

These disciplines are increasingly focused on the risks posed by climate change speciﬁcally. For ex-
ample, new sources of data have enabled detailed sensing of urban heat islands [613–615], water quality
[616, 617], and air pollution [618, 619]. Further, data on health indicators, which are already collected, can
quantitatively characterize observed impacts across regions as well as illuminate which populations are most
at risk to climate-change induced health hazards [620]. For example, it is known that the young, elderly,
and socially isolated are especially vulnerable during heat waves, and ﬁner-grained risk estimates could
potentially drive outreach [621, 622].

Across social applications, there are worthwhile research challenges – guiding interventions based on
purely observational, potentially unrepresentative data poses risks. In these contexts, transparency is nec-
essary, and ideally, causal effects of interventions could be estimated, to prevent feedback loops in which
certain subgroups are systematically ignored from policy interventions.

8.4 Crisis

Perhaps counterintuitively, natural disasters and health crises are not entirely unpredictable – they can be
prepared for, risks can be reduced, and coordination can be streamlined. Furthermore, while crises may be
some of the most distressing consequences of climate change, disaster response and public health are mature
disciplines in their own right, and have already beneﬁted extensively from ML methodology [623–625].

Managing epidemics
Climate change will increase the range of vector and water-borne diseases, elevating the likelihood that
these new environments experience epidemics [607]. Disease surveillance and outbreak forecasting systems
can be built from web data and specially-designed apps, in addition to traditional surveys [626–628]. While
non-survey proxies are observational and self-reported, current research attempts to address these issues
[629, 630]. Beyond surveillance, point-of-care diagnostics have enjoyed a renaissance, thanks in part to ML
[515, 631]. These are tools that allow health workers to make diagnoses when specialized lab equipment

45

is inaccessible. An example is malaria diagnosis based on photos of prepared pathology slides taken with
a mobile phone [632]. Ensuring that these systems reliably and transparently augment extension workers,
guiding data collection and route planning when appropriate, are active areas of study [633, 634].

Disaster response
High Leverage
In disaster preparation and response, two types of ML tasks have proven useful: creating maps from aerial
imagery and performing information retrieval on social media data. Accurate and well-annotated maps can
inform evacuation planning, retroﬁtting campaigns, and delivery of relief [635, 636]. Further, this imagery
can assist damage assessment, by comparing scenes immediately pre- and post-disaster [637, 638]. Social
media data can contain kernels of insight – places without water, clinics without supplies – which can inform
relief efforts. ML can help properly surface these insights, compressing large volumes of social media data
into the key takeaways, which can be acted upon by disaster managers [624, 639, 640].

8.5 Discussion

Climate change will have profound effects on the planet, and the ML community can support efforts to
minimize the damage it does to ecosystems and the harm it inﬂicts on people. This section has suggested
areas of research that may help societies adapt more effectively to these ever changing realities. We have
identiﬁed a few recurring themes, but also emphasized the role of understanding domain-speciﬁc needs. The
use of ML to support societal resilience would be a noble goal at any time, but the need for tangible progress
towards it may never have been so urgent as it is today, in the face of the wide-reaching consequences of
climate change.

9 Solar Geoengineering

by Andrew S. Ross

Airships ﬂoating through the sky, spraying aerosols; robotic boats crisscrossing the ocean, ﬁring vertical jets
of spray; arrays of mirrors carefully positioned in space, micro-adjusted by remote control: these images
seem like science ﬁction, but they are actually real proposals for solar radiation management, commonly
called solar geoengineering [641–644]. Solar geoengineering, much like the greenhouse gases causing
climate change, shifts the balance between how much heat the Earth absorbs and how much it releases. The
difference is that it is done deliberately, and in the opposite direction. The most common umbrella strategy
is to make the Earth more reﬂective, keeping heat out, though there are also methods of helping heat escape
(besides CO2 removal, which we discuss in §5 and §6).

Solar geoengineering generally comes with a host of potential side effects and governance challenges.
Moreover, unlike CO2 removal, it cannot simply reverse the effects of climate change (average temperatures
may return to pre-industrial levels, but location-speciﬁc climates still change), and also comes with the
risk of termination shock (fast, catastrophic warming if humanity undertakes solar geoengineering but stops
suddenly) [645]. Because of these and other issues, it is not within the scope of this paper to evaluate or
recommend any particular technique. However, the potential for solar geoengineering to moderate some
of the most catastrophic hazards of climate change is well-established [646], and it has received increasing
attention in the wake of societal inaction on mitigation. Although [644] argue that the “hardest and most
important problems raised by solar geoengineering are non-technical,” there are still a number of important
technical questions that machine learning may be able to help us study.

Overview
The primary candidate methods for geoengineering are marine cloud brightening [647] (making low-lying
clouds more reﬂective), cirrus thinning [648] (making high-ﬂying clouds trap less heat), and stratospheric
aerosol injection [649] (which we discuss below). Other candidates (which are either less effective or harder
to implement) include “white-roof” methods [650] and even launching sunshades into space [651].

Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere is considered a leading candidate for solar geoengineering
both because of its economic and technological feasibility [652, 653] and because of a reason that should
resonate with the ML community: we have data. (This data is largely in the form of temperature observations
after volcanic eruptions, which release sulfates into the stratosphere when sufﬁciently large [654].) Once
injected, sulfates circulate globally and remain aloft for 1 to 2 years. As a result, the process is reversible,
but must also be continually maintained. Sulfates come with a well-studied risk of ozone loss [655], and
they make sunlight slightly more diffuse, which can impact agriculture [656].

9.1 Understanding and improving aerosols

Design
Long-term
The effects and side-effects of aerosols in the stratosphere (or at slightly lower altitudes for cirrus thinning
[657]) vary signiﬁcantly with their optical and chemical properties. Although sulfates are the best under-
stood due to volcanic eruption data, many others have been studied, including zirconium dioxide, titanium
dioxide, calcite (which preserves ozone), and even synthetic diamond [658]. However, the design space
is far from fully explored. Machine learning has had recent success in predicting or even optimizing for
speciﬁc chemical and material properties [87, 92, 93, 458]. Although speculative, it is conceivable that ML
could accelerate the search for aerosols that are chemically nonreactive but still reﬂective, cheap, and easy
to keep aloft.

Modeling
One reason that sulfates have been the focus for aerosol research is that atmospheric aerosol physics is not

47

perfectly captured by current climate models, so having natural data is important for validation. Further-
more, even if current aerosol models are correct, their best-ﬁt parameters must still be determined (using
historical data), which comes with uncertainty and computational difﬁculty. ML may offer tools here, both
to help quantify and constrain uncertainty, and to manage computational load. As a recent example, [659]
use Gaussian processes to emulate climate model outputs based on nine possible aerosol parameter settings,
allowing them to establish plausible parameter ranges (and thus much better calibrated error-bars) with
only 350 climate model runs instead of >100,000. Although this is important progress, ideally we want
uncertainty-aware aerosol simulations with a fraction of the cost of one climate model run, rather than 350.
ML may be able to help here too (see §7 for more details).

9.2 Engineering a planetary control system

High Leverage Long-term Uncertain Impact

Efﬁcient emulations and error-bars will be essential for what MacMartin and Kravitz [660] call “The Engi-
neering of Climate Engineering.” According to [660], any practical deployment of geoengineering would
constitute “one of the most critical engineering design and control challenges ever considered: making
real-time decisions for a highly uncertain and nonlinear dynamic system with many input variables, many
measurements, and a vast number of internal degrees of freedom, the dynamics of which span a wide range
of timescales.” Bayesian and neural network-based approaches could facilitate the fast, uncertainty-aware
nonlinear system identiﬁcation this challenge might require. Additionally, there has been recent progress
in reinforcement learning for control [661–663], which could be useful for ﬁne-tuning geoengineering in-
terventions such as deciding where and when to release aerosols. For an initial attempt at analyzing strato-
spheric aerosol injection as a reinforcement learning problem (using a neural network climate model emu-
lator), see [664].

9.3 Modeling impacts

Long-term

Of course, optimizing interventions requires deﬁning objectives, and the choices here are far from clear.
Although it is possible to stabilize global mean temperature and even regional temperatures through geo-
engineering, it is most likely impossible to preserve all relevant climate characteristics in all locations.
Furthermore, climate model outputs do not tell the full story; ultimately, the goal of climate engineering
is to minimize harm to people, ecosystems, and society. It is therefore essential to develop robust tools for
estimating the extent and distribution of these potential harms. There has been some recent work in applying
ML to assess the impacts of geoengineering. For example, [665] use deep neural networks to estimate the
effects of aerosols on human health, while [666] use them to estimate the effects of solar geoengineering on
agriculture. References [667, 668] use relatively simple local and polynomial regression techniques but ap-
plied to extensive empirical data to estimate the past and future effects of temperature change on economic
production. More generally, the ﬁeld of Integrated Assessment Modeling [669, 670] aims to map the outputs
of a climate model to societal impacts; for a general discussion of potential opportunities for applying ML
to IAMs, see §11.2.

9.4 Discussion

Any consideration of solar geoengineering raises many moral questions.
It may help certain regions at
the expense of others, introduce risks like termination shock, and serve as a “moral hazard”: widespread
awareness of its very possibility may undermine mainstream efforts to cut emissions [671]. Because of
these issues, there has been signiﬁcant debate about whether it is ethically responsible to research this topic
[672, 673]. However, although it creates new risks, solar geoengineering could actually be a moderat-
ing force against the terrifying uncertainties climate change already introduces [646, 674], and ultimately

48

many environmental groups and governmental bodies have come down on the side of supporting further re-
search.36, 37, 38 In this section, we have attempted to outline some of the technical challenges in implement-
ing and evaluating solar geoengineering. We hope the ML community can help geoengineering researchers
tackle these challenges.

Tools for Action

10 Individual Action

by Natasha Jaques

Individuals may worry that they are powerless to affect climate change, or lack clarity on which of their
behaviors are most important to change. In fact, there are actions which can meaningfully reduce each
person’s carbon footprint, and, if widely adopted, could have a signiﬁcant impact on mitigating global
emissions [404, 675]. AI can help to identify those behaviors, inform individuals, and provide constructive
opportunities by modeling individual behavior.

10.1 Understanding personal carbon footprint

We as individuals are constantly confronted with decisions that affect our carbon footprint, but we may lack
the data and knowledge to know which decisions are most impactful. Fortunately, ML can help determine
an individual’s carbon footprint from their personal and household data.39 For example, natural language
processing can be used to extract the ﬂights a person takes from their email, or determine speciﬁc grocery
items purchased from a bill, making it possible to predict the associated emissions. Systems that combine
this information with data obtained from the user’s smartphone (e.g. from a ride-sharing app) can then help
consumers who wish to identify which behaviors result in the highest emissions. Given such a ML model,
counterfactual reasoning can potentially be used to demonstrate to consumers how much their emissions
would be reduced for each behavior they changed. As a privacy-conscious alternative, emissions estimates
could be directly incorporated into grocery labels [676] or interfaces for purchasing ﬂights. Such information
can empower people to understand how they can best help mitigate climate change through behavior change.
Residences are responsible for a large share of GHG emissions [4] (see also §3). A large meta-analysis
found that signiﬁcant residential energy savings can be achieved [677], by targeting the right interventions
to the right households [678–680]. ML can predict a household’s emissions in transportation, energy, water,
waste, foods, goods, and services, as a function of its characteristics [681]. These predictions can be used to
tailor customized interventions for high-emissions households [682]. Changing behavior both helps mitigate
climate change and beneﬁts individuals; studies have shown that many carbon mitigation strategies also
provide cost savings to consumers [681].

Household energy disaggregation breaks down overall electricity consumption into energy use by indi-
vidual appliances (see also §3.1) [683], which can help facilitate behavior change [684]. For example, it can
be used to inform consumers of high-energy appliances of which they were previously unaware. This alone
could have a signiﬁcant impact, since many devices consume a large amount of electricity even when not in
use; standby power consumption accounts for roughly 8% of residential electricity demand [685]. A variety
of ML techniques have been used to effectively disaggregate household energy, such as spectral clustering,
Hidden Markov Models, and neural networks [683].

ML can also be used to predict the marginal emissions of energy consumption in real time, on a scale of
hours,40 potentially allowing consumers to effectively schedule activities such as charging an electric vehicle
when the emissions (and prices [686]) will be lowest [687]. Combining these predictions with disaggregated
energy data allows for the efﬁcient automation of household energy consumption, ideally through products
that present interpretable insights to the consumer (e.g. [688, 689]). Methods like reinforcement learning
can be used to learn how to optimally schedule household appliances to consume energy more efﬁciently
and sustainably [690, 691]. Multi-agent learning has also been applied to this problem, to ensure that groups
of homes can coordinate to balance energy consumption to keep peak demand low [80, 83].

10.2 Facilitating behavior change

High Leverage

ML is highly effective at modeling human preferences, and this can be leveraged to help mitigate climate
change. Using ML, we can model and cluster individuals based on their climate knowledge, preferences, de-
mographics, and consumption characteristics (e.g. [692–696]), and thus predict who will be most amenable
to new technologies and sustainable behavior change. Such techniques have improved the enrollment rate
of customers in an energy savings program by 2-3x [678]. Other works have used ML to predict how much
consumers are willing to pay to avoid potential environmental harms of energy consumption [697], ﬁnding
that some groups were totally insensitive to cost and would pay the maximum amount to mitigate harm,
while other groups were willing to pay nothing. Given such disparate types of consumers, targeting inter-
ventions toward particular households may be especially worthwhile; all the more so because data show that
the size and composition of household carbon footprints varies dramatically across geographic regions and
demographics [681].

Citizens who would like to engage with policy decisions, or explore different options to reduce their per-
sonal carbon footprint, can have difﬁculty understanding existing laws and policies due to their complexity.
They may beneﬁt from tools that make policy information more manageable and relevant to the individual
(e.g. based on where the individual lives). There is the potential for natural language processing to derive
understandable insights from policy texts for these applications, similar to automated compliance checking
[698, 699].

Understanding individual behavior can help signal how it can be nudged. For example, path analysis
has shown that an individual’s psychological distance to climate change (on geographic, temporal, social,
and uncertainty dimensions) fully mediates their level of climate change concern [700]. This suggests that
interventions minimizing psychological distance to the effects of climate change may be most effective.
Similarly, ML has revealed that cross-cultural support for international climate programs is not reduced,
even when individuals are exposed to information about other countries’ climate behavior [701]. To make
the effects of climate change more real for consumers, and thus help motivate those who wish to act, image
generation techniques such as CycleGANs have been used to visualize the potential consequences of extreme
weather events on houses and cities [702]. Gamiﬁcation via deep learning has been proposed to further allow
individuals to explore their personal energy usage [703]. All of these programs may be an incredibly cost-
effective way to reduce energy consumption; behavior change programs can cost as little as 3 cents to save
a kilowatt hour of electricity, whereas generating one kWh would cost 5-6 cents with a coal or wind power
plant, and 10 cents with solar [704, 705].

10.3 Discussion

While individuals can sometimes feel that their contributions to climate change are dwarfed by other factors,
in reality individual actions can have a signiﬁcant impact in mitigating climate change. ML can aid this
process by empowering consumers to understand which of their behaviors lead to the highest emissions,
automatically scheduling energy consumption, and providing insights into how to facilitate behavior change.

11 Collective Decisions

by Tegan Maharaj and Nikola Milojevic-Dupont

Addressing climate change requires swift and effective decision-making by groups at multiple levels –
communities, unions, NGOs, businesses, governments, intergovernmental organizations, and many more.
Such collective decision-making encompasses many kinds of action – for example, negotiating international
treaties to reduce GHG emissions, designing carbon markets, building resilient infrastructure, and establish-
ing community-owned solar farms. These decisions often involve multiple stakeholders with different goals
and priorities, requiring difﬁcult trade-offs. The economic and societal systems involved are often extremely
complex, and the impacts of climate-related decisions can play out globally across long time horizons. To
address some of these challenges, researchers are using empirical and mathematical methods from ﬁelds
such as policy analysis, operations research, economics, game theory, and computational social science;
there are many opportunities for ML to support and supplement these methods.

11.1 Modeling social interactions

When designing climate change strategies, it is critical to understand how organizations and individuals act
and interact in response to different incentives and constraints. Agent-based models (ABMs) [706, 707]
represent one approach used in simulating the actions and interactions of agents (people, companies, etc.)
in their environment. ABMs have been applied to a multitude of problems relevant to climate change,
in particular to study low-carbon technology adoption [708–711]. For example, when modeling solar PV
adoption [712], agents may represent individuals who act based on factors such as ﬁnancial interest and the
behavior of their peers [713, 714]; the goal is then to study how these agents interact in response to different
conditions, such as electricity rates, subsidy programs, and geographical considerations. Other applications
of ABMs include modeling how behavior under social norms changes with external pressures [715], how
the economy and climate may evolve given a diversity of political and economic beliefs [716], and how
individuals may migrate in response to environmental changes [717]. While agent and environment models
in ABMs are often hand-designed by experts, ML can help integrate data-driven insights into these models
[718], for example by learning rules or models for agents based on observational data [712, 719], or by using
unsupervised methods such as VAEs or GANs to discover salient features useful in modeling a complex
environment. While the hope of learning or tuning behavior from data is promising for generalization,
many data-driven approaches lose the interpretability for which ABMs are valued; work in interpretable ML
methods could potentially help with this.

In addition to ABMs, techniques from game theory can be valuable in modeling behavior, e.g. to ex-
plore cooperation in the face of a depleting resource [720]. Multi-agent reinforcement learning can also be
applied to understand the behavior of groups of agents who need to cooperate; see [721] for an overview
and [722, 723] for recent examples. Combined with mechanism design,41 such approaches can be used to
design methods for cooperation that lead to mutually beneﬁcial outcomes, for example when formalizing
procedures around international climate agreements [724, 725].

11.2

Informing policy

The actions required to address climate change, both in mitigation and adaptation, require making policies42
at the local, national, and international levels [726]. Various institutions act as policy-makers: for instance,
governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, standards committees, and pro-
fessional institutions. Tools from policy analysis – the process of evaluating the outcomes of past policies

41Mechanism design is often called “inverse game theory” – rather than determining optimal strategies for players, mechanism

design seeks to design games such that certain strategies are incentivized.

42Policy can refer, for example, to laws, measures, standards, or best practices.

52

and assessing future policy alternatives43 – can help inform the choices these institutions make. Policy anal-
ysis uses quantitative tools from statistics, economics, and operations research such as cost-beneﬁt analysis,
uncertainty analysis, and multi-criteria decision making to inform the policy-making process; see [727, 728]
for an introduction. ML can provide data for policy analysis, help improve existing tools for assessing policy
options, and provide new tools for evaluating the effects of policies.

Gathering data
High Leverage
When creating policies, decision-makers must often negotiate fundamental uncertainties in the underlying
data. ML can help alleviate some of this uncertainty by providing data. For instance, as detailed elsewhere
in this paper, ML can help pinpoint sources of emissions (§1.2,5.1), approximate trafﬁc patterns (§2.1),
identify infrastructure at risk (§8.2), and mine information from companies’ ﬁnancial disclosures (§13).
Natural language processing, network analysis, and clustering techniques can also be used to analyze social
media data to understand public opinions and discourse around climate change [729–731]. These data can
then be used to identify areas of intervention, compute the beneﬁts and costs of a project, or evaluate the
effectiveness of a policy after it has been implemented.

Assessing policy options
Decision-makers often construct mathematical models to help them assess or trade off between different
policy alternatives. ML is particularly relevant to approaches that model large and complex socio-economic
systems to assess outcomes of particular strategies, as well as optimization-based tools that help with navi-
gating the decision.

Policy-makers often wish to analyze how different policy alternatives may contribute to achieving a
particular objective. Computational approaches such as simulation and (partial) equilibrium models can be
used to compare different policy options, assess the effects of underlying assumptions, or propose strategies
that are consistent with the objectives of decision-makers. Of particular relevance to climate change miti-
gation are integrated assessment models (IAMs), which incorporate economic models, climate models, and
policy information (see [732] for an overview). IAMs are used to explore future societal pathways that are
consistent with climate goals (e.g. 1.5◦C mean global temperature increase), and play a prominent role in
the IPCC assessments [733]. While these models can simulate interactions between many variables in great
detail, this comes at the cost of computational complexity and presents opportunities for machine learning.
Much as with Earth system models (§7), ML can be applied within any of the various sub-models that make
up an IAM. One set of applications involves deriving results at the appropriate spatial resolution, since dif-
ferent components of an IAM operate at different scales. Outputs with high resolution may be aggregated
via clustering methods to provide insights [734], while at coarser resolution, statistical downscaling can help
to disaggregate data to an appropriate spatial resolution, as seen in applications such as crop yield [735],
wind speed [736] or surface temperature [737]. ML also has the potential to help with sensitivity and uncer-
tainty analysis [738], with ﬁnding numerical solutions for computational expensive submodels [739, 740],
and assessing the validity of the models [741].

In addition to assessing the outcomes of various policies, policy-makers may also employ optimization-
based tools to ﬁgure out what decisions to make. For example, combinatorial optimization is a powerful tool
used widely for decision-making in operations research. See [194] for a survey of how ML can be employed
to help solve combinatorial optimization problems.

Tools from the ﬁeld of multi-criteria decision-making can also help policy-makers manage trade-offs
between different policies by reconciling competing objectives and minimizing negative side-effects; in par-
ticular, in cases where policy objectives and constraints can be mathematically formalized, multi-objective

optimization can provide a pragmatic approach to making decisions. Here, a decision-maker would formu-
late their decision-making process as an optimization problem by combining multiple optimization objec-
tives subject to physical or other types of constraints; the goal is to then ﬁnd a solution (or set of solutions)
that is Pareto-optimal with respect to all of the objective functions. However, ﬁnding these solutions is
often computationally expensive. Practitioners have applied bio-inspired algorithms such as particle swarm,
genetic, or evolutionary algorithms to search for or compute Pareto-optimal solutions that satisfy the con-
straints. This approach has been applied in a number of climate change-related ﬁelds, including energy and
infrastructure planning [111, 742–746], industry [747, 748], land use [749, 750], and more [751–754]. Pre-
vious work has also employed parallel surrogate search, assisted by ML, to efﬁciently solve multi-objective
optimization problems [755]. Optimization algorithms which have been successful in the context of hy-
perparameter tuning (e.g. Bayesian optimization [756, 757]) or guided search algorithms (e.g. tree search
algorithms [758]) could also potentially be applied to this problem.

Evaluating policy effects
High Leverage
When creating new policies, decision-makers may wish to understand previous policies (e.g. from other
jurisdictions) and how these policies performed. ML can help analyze previous policy actions automatically
and at scale by improving computational text analysis. In particular, natural language processing meth-
ods are already used in the ﬁeld of political science to analyze political texts and legislation [759]; these
approaches could be promising for systematically studying climate change policies. Causal inference tech-
niques can also help assess the effect of a particular policy or climate-related event from observed outcomes.
ML can play a role in causal inference [760–762], including in the context of policy problems [763, 764]
and in climate-relevant scenarios such as estimating the effects of temperature on human mortality [765]
and the effects of World Bank projects on vegetative cover [766].

11.3 Designing markets

In economics, GHG emissions can be seen as a negative externality: while a changing climate results in
a cost for society, this cost is often not reﬂected in the market price of goods or services that cause GHG
emissions. This is problematic, since organizations and individuals making decisions solely on the basis of
market prices will tend to favor cheaper goods, even if those goods emit a large amount of GHGs. Market-
based tools44 such as carbon taxes aim to enforce prices reﬂecting the societal cost of GHGs and thus
encourage socially beneﬁcial behavior through market forces. ML can help in understanding the impacts
of market instruments; assessing their effectiveness at reducing emissions; and supporting a swift, effective
and fair implementation.45

Predicting carbon prices
There are several approaches to pricing GHG emissions. Carbon taxes and quotas aim to inﬂuence the
behavior of organizations by shaping supply and demand within an existing market. By contrast, cap-and-
trade approaches such as those within the European Union involve a completely new market, an Emissions
Trading Scheme, within which companies can buy and sell a limited number of GHG emissions permits.
Prices within such cap-and-trade markets are highly sensitive to control elements such as the number of
permits released at a given time. ML can be used to analyze prices within these markets, for example by
predicting prices via supervised learning [771–774] or analyzing the main drivers of prices via hierarchical
clustering [775].

44For background on market-based strategies, see [767–769].
45For a review on ML for energy economics and ﬁnance, see [770].

54

Non-carbon markets
Market design can inﬂuence GHG emissions even in settings where such emissions are not directly penal-
ized. For instance, dynamic pricing in electricity markets – varying the price of electricity to consumers
based on, e.g., how much wind power is available – can shape demand for low-carbon energy sources (see
§1.1.1). Following seminal research on modeling pricing in markets as a bandit problem [776], many works
have applied bandit and other reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to determine prices or other market
values. For example, RL has been applied to predict bids [777] and market power [778] in electricity mar-
kets, and to set dynamic prices in more general settings [79]. ML can also help solve auctions in supply
chains [196].

Assessing market effects
When designing market-based strategies, it is necessary to understand how effectively each strategy will
reduce emissions, as well as how the underlying socio-technical system may be affected. Studies have
considered effects of carbon pricing on economic growth and energy intensity [779, 780], or on electricity
prices [781]. Effects of pricing mechanisms can also be indirect, as companies’ strategic decisions can have
longer-term effects. ML can be useful in analyzing these effects. For example, self-organizing maps have
been used to analyze how R&D investment in green technologies changes in response to fuel prices [782],
while a game theoretical framework using neural networks has been used to study the optimal production
strategies for companies under carbon quotas [783].

To ensure that market-based strategies are effective and equitable, it is important to understand their
distributional effects, as certain social groups or classes of stakeholders may be affected more than others.
For example, a ﬂat carbon tax on gasoline will have a larger effect on lower-income populations, as fuel
expenses are a bigger share of their total budget. Here, clustering can help identify permit allocation schemes
that maximize social welfare [784], and supervised learning has been used to predict winners and losers
from changing electricity tariff schemes [785]. Hedonic pricing can also help identify how much different
consumers may be willing to pay for a environmental good or a service, which is a noisy measure for the
monetary value of that good or service; these values are typically inferred using regression or ML techniques
on historical market data [786–789].
It is also important to analyze which organizations or individuals
can actually participate in a given market. For example, carbon markets can be more ﬂexible if viable
offsets exist, including those offered by landowners who sequester carbon through forest conservation and
management; ML has been used to examine the factors inﬂuencing the ﬁnancial viability of such projects
[790].

11.4 Discussion

The complexity, scale, and fundamental uncertainty inherent in the problems of climate change can pose
challenges for collective decision-making. ML can help supplement existing mathematical frameworks that
are employed to alleviate some of these challenges, including agent-based models, integrated assessment
models, multi-objective optimization, and market design. Interpretable and fair ML techniques may be of
particular importance in this context, as they may enable decision-makers to more effectively and equitably
employ insights from ML models. While these quantitative assessment tools can provide useful input to
the decision-making process, it is worth noting that decisions regarding climate change may ultimately
depend on qualitative discussions around norms, values, or equity considerations that may not be captured
in quantitative models.

12 Education

by Alexandra Luccioni

Access to quality education is a key part of sustainable development, with signiﬁcant beneﬁts for climate
and society at large. Education contributes to improving quality of life, helps individuals make informed
decisions, and trains the next generation of innovators. Education is also paramount in helping people across
societies understand and address the causes and consequences of climate change and provides the skills
and tools necessary for adapting to its impacts. For instance, education can both improve the resilience
of communities, particularly in developing countries that will be disproportionately affected by climate
change [791], and empower individuals, especially from developed countries, to adopt more sustainable
lifestyles [792]. As climate change itself may diminish educational outcomes for some populations, due
to its negative effects on agricultural productivity and household income [793, 794], this makes providing
high-quality educational interventions globally all the more important.

AI in Education
Long-term
There are a number of ways that AI and ML can contribute to education and teaching – for instance by
improving access to educational opportunities, helping personalize the teaching process, and stepping in
when teachers have limited time. The ﬁeld of AIED (Artiﬁcial Intelligence in EDucation) has existed for
over 30 years, and until recently relied on explicitly modeling content, learners, and tutoring strategies based
on psychological theories of learning. However, AIED is increasingly incorporating data-driven insights
derived from ML techniques.

One important area of AIED research has been Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs), which can adapt
their behavior in real time according to the needs of individuals or to support collaborative learning [795].
While ITSs have traditionally been deﬁned and constructed by hand, recent approaches have applied ML
techniques such as multi-armed bandit techniques to adaptively personalize sequences of learning activ-
ities [796], LSTMs to generate questions to evaluate language comprehension [797], and reinforcement
learning to improve the strategies used within the ITS [798, 799]. However, there remains much work to
be done to bridge the performance gap between digital and human tutors, and ML-based approaches have
an important role to play in this endeavor – for example, via natural language processing techniques for
creating conversational agents [800], learner analytics for classifying student proﬁles, [801], and adaptive
learning approaches to propose relevant educational activities and exercises [802]. 46

While ITSs generally focus on individualized or small-group instruction, AIED can also help provide
tools that improve educational outcomes at scale for larger groups of learners. For instance, scalable, adap-
tive online courses could give hundreds of thousands of learners access to learning resources that they would
not usually have in their local educational facilities [806]. Furthermore, giving teachers guidance derived
from computational teaching algorithms or heuristics could help them design better educational curricula
and improve student learning outcomes [807]. In this context, AIED applications can be used either as a
standalone tool for independent learners or as an educational resource that frees up teachers to have more
one-on-one time with students. Key considerations for creating AIED tools that can be applied across
the globe include adapting to local technological and cultural needs, addressing barriers such as access to
electricity and internet [142, 143], and taking into account students’ computing skills, language, and cul-
ture [808, 809].

Learning about climate
Research has shown that educational activities centered on climate change and carbon footprints can en-
gage learners in understanding the connection between personal and collective actions and their impact on

global climate, and can enable individuals to make climate-friendly lifestyle choices such as reducing en-
ergy use [810]. There have also been proposals for interactive websites explaining climate science as well
as educational interventions focusing on local and actionable aspects of sustainable development [811]. In
these contexts, ML can help create personalized educational tools, for instance by generating images of
future impacts of extreme weather events based on a learner’s address [702] or by anchoring an individual’s
learning experience in a digital replica of their real-life location and allowing them to explore the way that
climate change will impact a speciﬁc location [812].

13 Finance

by Alexandra Luccioni

The rise and fall of ﬁnancial markets is linked to many events, both sporadic (e.g. the 2008 global ﬁnancial
crisis) and cyclical (e.g. the price of gas over the years), with proﬁts and losses that can be measured in the
billions of dollars and can have global consequences. Climate change poses a substantial ﬁnancial risks to
global assets measured in the trillions of dollars [813], and it is hard to forecast where, how, or when climate
change will impact the stock price of a given company, or even the debt of an entire nation. While ﬁnancial
analysts and investors focus on pricing risk and forecasting potential earnings, the majority of the current
ﬁnancial system is based on quarterly or yearly performance. This fails to incentivize the prediction of
medium or long-term risks, which include most climate change-related exposures such as physical impacts
on assets or distribution chains, legislative impacts on proﬁt generation, and indirect market consequences
such as supply and demand.47

Climate investment
Climate investment, the current dominant approach in climate ﬁnance, involves investing money in low-
carbon assets [817]. The dominant ways in which major ﬁnancial institutions take this approach are by
creating “green” ﬁnancial indexes that focus on low-carbon energy, clean technology, and/or environmental
services [818] or by designing carbon-neutral investment portfolios that remove or under-weight companies
with relatively high carbon footprints [819]. This investment strategy is creating major shifts in certain
sectors of the market (e.g. utilities and energy) towards renewable energy alternatives, which are seen as
having a greater growth potential than traditional energy sources such as oil and gas [820]. While this
approach currently does not utilize ML directly, we see the potential in applying deep learning both for
portfolio selection (based on features of the stocks involved) and investment timing (using historical patterns
to predict future demand), to maximize both the impact and scope of climate investment strategies.

Climate analytics
High Leverage
The other main approach to climate ﬁnance is climate analytics, which aims to predict the ﬁnancial effects of
climate change, and is still gaining momentum in the mainstream ﬁnancial community [817]. Since this is a
predictive approach to addressing climate change from a ﬁnancial perspective, it is one where ML can poten-
tially have greater impact. Climate analytics involves analyzing investment portfolios, funds, and companies
in order to pinpoint areas with heightened risk due to climate change, such as timber companies that could
be bankrupted by wildﬁres or water extraction initiatives that could see their sources polluted by shifting
landscapes. Approaches used in this ﬁeld include: natural language processing techniques for identifying
climate risks and investment opportunities in disclosures made by companies [821] as well as for analyzing
the evolution of climate coverage in the media to dynamically hedge climate change risk [822]; economet-
ric approaches for developing arbitrage strategies that take advantage of the carbon risk factor in ﬁnancial
markets [823]; and ML approaches for forecasting the price of carbon in emission exchanges48 [825, 826].
To date, the ﬁeld of climate ﬁnance has been largely neglected within the larger scope of ﬁnancial re-
search and analysis. This leaves many directions for improvement, such as (1) improving existing traditional
portfolio optimization approaches; (2) in-depth modeling of variables linked to climate risk; (3) designing
a statistical climate factor that can be used to project the variation of stock prices given a compound set of
events; and (4) identifying direct and indirect climate risk exposure in annual company reports. ML plays
a central role in these strategies, and can be a powerful tool in leveraging the ﬁnancial sector to mitigate
climate change and in reducing the ﬁnancial impacts of climate change on society.

47For further reading regarding the impact of climate change on ﬁnancial markets, see [814–816].
48Carbon pricing, e.g. via CO2 cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, is a commonly-suggested policy approach for getting ﬁrms to price

future climate change impacts into their ﬁnancial calculations. For an introduction to these topics, see [824] and also §11.3.

Conclusion

Machine learning, like any technology, does not always make the world a better place — but it can. In the
ﬁght against climate change, we have seen that ML has signiﬁcant contributions to offer across domain areas.
ML can enable automatic monitoring through remote sensing (e.g. by pinpointing deforestation, gathering
data on buildings, and assessing damage after disasters). It can accelerate the process of scientiﬁc discovery
(e.g. by suggesting new materials for batteries, construction, and carbon capture). ML can optimize systems
to improve efﬁciency (e.g. by consolidating freight, designing carbon markets, and reducing food waste).
And it can accelerate computationally expensive physical simulations through hybrid modeling (e.g. climate
models and energy scheduling models). These and other cross-cutting themes are shown in Table 2. We
emphasize that in each application, ML is only one part of the solution; it is a tool that enables other tools
across ﬁelds.

Applying machine learning to tackle climate change has the potential both to beneﬁt society and to
advance the ﬁeld of machine learning. Many of the problems we have discussed here highlight cutting-
edge areas of ML, such as interpretability, causality, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation. Moreover, meaningful
action on climate problems requires dialogue with ﬁelds within and outside computer science and can lead
to interdisciplinary methodological innovations, such as improved physics-constrained ML techniques.

The nature of climate-relevant data poses challenges and opportunities. For many of the applications we
identify, data can be proprietary or include sensitive personal information. Where datasets exist, they may
not be organized with a speciﬁc task in mind, unlike typical ML benchmarks that have a clear objective.
Datasets may include information from heterogeneous sources, which must be integrated using domain
knowledge. Moreover, the available data may not be representative of global use cases. For example,
forecasting weather or electricity demand in the US, where data are abundant, is very different from doing
so in India, where data can be scarce. Tools from transfer learning and domain adaptation will likely prove
essential in low-data settings. For some tasks, it may also be feasible to augment learning with carefully
simulated data. Of course, the best option if possible is always more real data; we strongly encourage public
and private entities to release datasets and to solicit involvement from the ML community.

For those who want to apply ML to climate change, we provide a roadmap:

• Learn. Identify how your skills may be useful – we hope this paper is a starting point.

• Collaborate. Find collaborators, who may be researchers, entrepreneurs, established companies, or
policy makers. Every domain discussed here has experts who understand its opportunities and pitfalls,
even if they do not necessarily understand ML.

• Listen. Listen to what your collaborators and other stakeholders say is needed. Groundbreaking

technologies have an impact, but so do well-constructed solutions to mundane problems.

• Deploy. Ensure that your work is deployed where its impact can be realized.

We call upon the machine learning community to use its skills as part of the global effort against climate
change.
